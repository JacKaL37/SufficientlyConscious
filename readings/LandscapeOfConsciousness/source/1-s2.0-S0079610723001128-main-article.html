and mechanisms. Categories: Materialism Theories (philosophical, neurobiological, electromagnetic field, computational and informational, homeostatic and affective, embodied and enactive, relational, representational, language, phylogenetic evolution); Non-Reductive Physicalism; Quantum Theories; Integrated Information Theory; Panpsychisms; Monisms; Dualisms; Idealisms; Anomalous and Altered States Theories; Challenge Theories. There are many subcategories, especially for Materialism Theories. Each explanation is self-described by its adherents, critique is minimal and only for clarification, and there is no attempt to adjudicate among theories. The implications of consciousness explanations or theories are assessed with respect to four questions: meaning/purpose/value (if any); AI consciousness; virtual immortality; and survival beyond death. A Landscape of Consciousness, I suggest, offers perspective.</p></div></div></div><div id="reading-assistant" style=""></div><ul id="issue-navigation" class="issue-navigation u-margin-s-bottom u-bg-grey1"><li class="previous move-left u-padding-s-ver u-padding-s-left"><a class="button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary u-display-flex button-alternative-icon-left" href="/science/article/pii/S0079610724000476"><svg focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 54 128" height="20" class="icon icon-navigate-left"><path d="M1 61l45-45 7 7-38 38 38 38-7 7z"></path></svg><span class="button-alternative-text-container"><span class="button-alternative-text">Previous <span class="extra-detail-1">article</span><span class="extra-detail-2"> in issue</span></span></span></a></li><li class="next move-right u-padding-s-ver u-padding-s-right"><a class="button-alternative button-alternative-tertiary u-display-flex button-alternative-icon-right" href="/science/article/pii/S0079610724000464"><span class="button-alternative-text-container"><span class="button-alternative-text">Next <span class="extra-detail-1">article</span><span class="extra-detail-2"> in issue</span></span></span><svg focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 54 128" height="20" class="icon icon-navigate-right"><path d="M1 99l38-38L1 23l7-7 45 45-45 45z"></path></svg></a></li></ul><div class="Keywords u-font-serif"><div id="kwrds0010" class="keywords-section"><h2 class="section-title u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">Keywords</h2><div id="kwrd0010" class="keyword"><span>Consciousness</span></div><div id="kwrd0015" class="keyword"><span>Mind-body problem</span></div><div id="kwrd0020" class="keyword"><span>Materialism</span></div><div id="kwrd0025" class="keyword"><span>Monism</span></div><div id="kwrd0030" class="keyword"><span>Dualism</span></div><div id="kwrd0035" class="keyword"><span>Idealism</span></div></div></div><div class="Body u-font-serif" id="body"><div><p id="p0010">Explanations of consciousness abound and the radical diversity of theories is telling.

Next, I assesss implications of categories for “big questions.” Thus, this Landscape is not about how consciousness is measured or evolved or even works, but about what consciousness <em>is</em> and what difference it makes.</p><p id="p0020">It's the classic “mind-body problem:” How do the felt experiences in our minds relate to the neural processes in our brains? How do mental states, whether sensory, cognitive, emotional, or even noumenal (selfless) awareness, correlate with brain states? The Landscape of Consciousness explanations or theories I want to draw is as broad as possible, including those that cannot be subsumed by, and possibly not even accessed by, the scientific method. This freedom from constraint, as it were, is no excuse for wooly thinking. Standards of rationality and clarity of argument must be maintained even more tenaciously, and bases of beliefs must be specified even more clearly.</p><p id="p0025">I have two main aims: (i) gather and describe the various theories and array them in some kind of meaningful structure of high-level or first-order categories (and under Materialism, subcategories); and (ii) assess their implications, with respect to four big questions: meaning/purpose/value (if any); artificial intelligence (AI) consciousness; virtual immortality; and survival beyond death.</p><p id="p0030">Theories overlap; some work together. Moreover, while a real-world landscape of consciousness, even simplified, would be drawn with three dimensions (at least), with multiple kinds and levels of nestings—a combinatorial explosion (and likely no closer to truth)—I satisfice with a one-dimensional toy-model. I array all the theories on a linear spectrum, simplistically and roughly, from the “most physical” on the left (at the beginning) to the “least physical” on the right (near the end).<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn5" name="bfn5" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn5"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>5</sup></span></span></a> (I have two final categories after this spectrum.) The physicalism assumed in Materialism Theories of consciousness is characterized by naturalistic, science-based perspectives, while non-materialism theories have various degrees of nonphysicalist perspectives outside the ambit of current science and in some cases not subject to the scientific method of experimentation and replicability.</p><p id="p0035">Please do not ascribe the relative importance of a theory to the relative size of its description. The shortest can be the strongest. It sometimes takes more words to describe lesser-known theories. For each description I feel the tension between conciseness and completeness. Moreover, several are not complete theories in themselves but ways to think about consciousness that strike me as original and perhaps insightful.</p><p id="p0040">I have followed consciousness studies in its various forms for my entire life.

That's the grandest question.” She distinguishes two major questions. One is whether psychological states—our mental life of remembering, thinking, creating—are really a subset of brain activity? The other is how do high-level psychological processes come about from basic neurophysiological actions? “How do brain cells, organized in their complex ways, give rise to my watching something move, or seeing color, or smelling a rose”(<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib153" name="bbib153" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib153"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Churchland, 2000</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib464" name="bbib464" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib464"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kuhn, 2000a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib465" name="bbib465" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib465"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2000b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0055">Philosopher David Papineau distinguishes three questions related to consciousness: <em>How?</em>, <em>Where?</em>, and <em>What?</em> “First, <em>how</em> does consciousness relate to other features of reality?

Qualia—the felt qualities of inner experience—are the crux of the mind-body problem.</p><p id="p0115">Chalmers describes qualia as “the raw sensations of experience.” He says, “I see colors—reds, greens, blues—and they feel a certain way to me. I see a red rose; I hear a clarinet; I smell mothballs. All of these feel a certain way to me. You must experience them to know what they're like. You could provide a perfect, complete map of my brain [down to elementary particles]—what's going on when I see, hear, smell—but if I haven't seen, heard, smelled for myself, that brain map is not going to tell me about the quality of seeing red, hearing a clarinet, smelling mothballs. You must experience it.”</p><p id="p0120">Since qualia constitutes the core of the “hard problem,” and since the hard problem has come to so dominate consciousness studies such that almost every theorist must confront it, seeking either to explain it or refute it—and since the hard problem is a leitmotiv of this Landscape—I asked Dave about its backstory.<blockquote><p id="dspara0010">“I first remember presenting the hard problem in a talk at the first Tucson ‘Toward a Science of Consciousness’ consciousness in 1994. When did I first use it? Did I use it in writing before then? I’ve looked in my writing and have not found it [i.e., not prior to the 1994 talk]. The hard problem was part of the talk. I remember speaking with some students beforehand, saying I’m going to talk about ‘hard problems, easy problems.’ I had been already talking this way in my seminar the previous year, so maybe it was already becoming part of my thinking. But I didn’t think about it as an ‘insight.’ I just thought it a way of stating the obvious. ‘Yeah, there’s a really hard problem here.’ So, as part of the first couple of minutes of my talk, I said something like ‘everyone knows there is a hard problem’ …. And people took it and said ‘it’s this great insight’ … Well, it did become a catchy meme; it became a way of encapsulating the problem of consciousness in a way that made it difficult to ignore, and I’m grateful for that role. I had no idea at the time that it would catch on, but it’s good because the problem of consciousness is really easy to ignore or to sidestep, and having this phrase, ‘the hard problem,’ has made it difficult to do that. There’s now just a very natural response whenever that happens. You say, ‘Well, that’s addressing the easy problem, but it’s not addressing the hard problem.’ I think this helps in getting both scientists and philosophers to take consciousness seriously. But I can’t take credit for the idea. Everyone knew that consciousness was a hard problem way before me—my colleagues, Tom Nagel and Ned Block; philosophers like C.D. Broad almost 100 years ago; Thomas Huxley back in the 19th century; even Leibniz and Descartes—they all knew that consciousness was a hard problem” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib131" name="bbib131" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib131"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2016b</span></span></a>).</p></blockquote></p><p id="p0125">Over the years, while Chalmers has played a leading role in expanding and enriching the field of consciousness studies (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib133" name="bbib133" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib133"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2018</span></span></a>), his overarching views have not changed: “I don't think the hard problem of consciousness can be solved purely in terms of neuroscience.” As science journalist George Musser puts it, “By ‘hard,’ Chalmers meant impossible. Science as we now practice it, he argued, ‘is inherently unable to explain consciousness’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib558" name="bbib558" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib558"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Musser, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib559" name="bbib559" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib559"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Musser, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0130">This does not mean, of course, that Chalmers is making a case for “substance dualism,” some nonphysical stuff (like the immortal souls of many religions). Chalmers is postulating a “naturalistic dualism,” where perhaps “information” is the connective, because while information is not material, it is embedded in the physical world. He notes, “We can also find information realized in our phenomenology.” This is a “naturalistic dualism,” a kind of property dualism (15.1).</p><p id="p0135">To Chalmers, “It is natural to hope that there will be a materialist solution to the hard problem and a reductive explanation of consciousness, just as there have been reductive explanations of many other phenomena in many other domains. But consciousness seems to resist materialist explanation in a way that other phenomena do not.” He encapsulates this resistance in three related arguments against materialism: (i) The Explanatory Argument (“explaining structure and function does not suffice to explain consciousness”); (ii) The Conceivability Argument (“it is conceivable that there be a system that is physically identical to a conscious being, but that lacks at least some of that being's conscious states”); (iii) The Knowledge Argument (“someone could know all the physical facts … and still be unable to know all the facts about consciousness”) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib124" name="bbib124" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib124"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2003</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0140">“Physicalists, of course, resist these arguments,” says Philosopher Frank Jackson. “Some deny the modal and epistemic claims the arguments use as premises. They may grant (as they should) the intuitive appeal of the claim that a zombie physical duplicate of me is possible, but insist that, when one looks at the matter more closely, one can see that a zombie physical duplicate of me is not in fact possible. Any physical duplicate of me must feel pain when they stub their toe, have things look green to them on occasion, and so on” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib404" name="bbib404" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib404"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jackson, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0145">Philosopher Daniel Stoljar targets the conceivability argument (“CA”). Strictly speaking, he says, “CA is an argument against the truth of physicalism. However, since it presupposes the existence of consciousness, it may be regarded also as an argument for the incompatibility of physicalism and the existence of consciousness.” Stoljar's epistemic view offers a two-part response. “The first part supposes that there is a type of physical fact or property that is relevant to consciousness but of which we are ignorant.” He calls this the <em>ignorance hypothesis</em>. The second part “argues that, if the ignorance hypothesis is true, CA is unpersuasive” for reasons of logic (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 92, 95).</p><p id="p0150">Philosopher Yujin Nagasawa calls “The Knowledge Argument” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib398" name="bbib398" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib398"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jackson, 1982</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib399" name="bbib399" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib399"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">1986</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib400" name="bbib400" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib400"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">1995</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib402" name="bbib402" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib402"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">1998</span></span></a>) “among the strongest arguments (or possibly the strongest argument) for the claim that there is [in consciousness] something beyond the physical” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib567" name="bbib567" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib567"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Nagasawa, 2012a</span></span></a>).

And what we do is we take a lot of different phenomena and we give them all the same name, and then you think you've got it.” Minsky enjoys dissecting consciousness: “When people use the word ‘consciousness,’ it's a very strange idea that there's some wonderful property of the brain that can do so many different things—at least four or five major things and dozens of others. For example, if I ask, ‘were you conscious that you touched your ear?’ You might say ‘no, I didn't know I did that.’ You might say, ‘yes.’ If you say yes, it's because some part of your mind, the part that talks, has access to something that remembers what's happened recently with your arm and your ear.” Minsky notes “there are hundreds of kinds of awarenesses. There's remembering something as an image. There's remembering something as a string of words. There's remembering the tactile feeling of something” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib546" name="bbib546" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib546"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Minsky, 2007a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0200">Minsky says there is no harm in having consciousness as a suitcase term for social purposes.

There's a whole community of scientists who are trying to find the place in the brain where consciousness is.

The former distinguishes what we can know from what really exists; they can be the same, of course, but that determination may not be a superficial one and in fact may not be possible, in practice or even in principle. The latter has an asymmetrical relationship in that causation must involve correlation whereas correlation does not necessarily involve causation; the dyadic entities that correlate might each be caused by an unknown hidden factor that just so happens to cause each of them independently.</p><p id="p0265">In addition, there are questions about the phylogenetic evolution of consciousness (9.10). Is it a gradual gradient, from simple single-cells seeking homeostasis via stimulus-response to environmental pressures, relatively smoothly up the phylogenetic tree to human-level consciousness (as is conventional wisdom)?

To begin, there are (at least) three next questions:</p><p id="p0345">First, is consciousness “real,” or, on the other hand, is it sufficiently an “illusion,” a brain trick, as it were, which would render consternation over the conundrum moot, if not meaningless?</p><p id="p0350">Second, if consciousness is real (and not primitive), then since in some sense it would be emergent, would this emergence of consciousness be “weak,” meaning that in principle it could be explained by, or reduced to, more fundamental science (even if in practice, it could not be, for a long time, if ever)?</p><p id="p0355">Third, if weak emergence has insufficient resources, would this emergence of consciousness be “strong,” meaning that it would be forever impossible to totally explain consciousness, even in principle, by reducing it to more fundamental levels of scientific explanation (9.1.4).</p><p id="p0360">Finally, is there an intermediate position, where consciousness was not fundamental ab initio, but when it evolved or emerged, consciousness came to become somehow inevitable, more than an accidental byproduct of physical processes?

The Landscape I present is populated primarily by claims of what consciousness actually is, not how it functions and not how it evolved over deep time (although both how it functions and how it evolved may well reflect what it is). This is not a landscape of how consciousness emerged or its purpose or its content—sensations, perceptions, cognitions, emotions, language—none of these—although all of these are recruited by various explanations on offer.</p><p id="p0430">Mechanisms of consciousness are relevant here only to the extent that they elucidate a core theory of consciousness. For example, the “neurogeographic” debate between the “front of the head” folks—the Global Workspace (9.2.3) and Higher-Order (9.8.3) theorists—and the “back of the head” folks—the Integrated Information (4) and Recurrent Processing (9.8.2) theorists—is essential for a complete neurobiological explanation of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib72" name="bbib72" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib72"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Block, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 417–418), but it is of only mild interest for an ontological survey of the Landscape. If the Global Workplace suddenly shifted to the back of the head, and Integrated Information to the front, would the “trading-places” inversion make much ontological difference?</p><p id="p0435">Traditionally and simplistically, the clash is between materialism/physicalism and dualism or idealism; such oversimplification may be part of the problem—other categories and subcategories have standing.</p><p id="p0440">The alternative theories of consciousness that follow come about via my hundreds of conversations and decades of readings and night-musings. I array 10 categories of explanations or theories of consciousness; all but one present multiple specific theories; only Materialism has subcategories. (There are many ways to envision a landscape, of course, and, as a result, many ways to array theories. I claim no privileged view.)</p><p id="p0445">Here are the 10 primary categories of explanations or theories: Materialism Theories (with many subcategories); Non-Reductive Physicalism; Quantum Theories; Integrated Information Theory; Panpsychisms; Monisms; Dualisms; Idealisms; Anomalous and Altered States Theories; Challenge Theories.</p><p id="p0450">It is no surprise that Materialism Theories have by far the largest number of specific theories. It is the only category with a three-level organization: there are 10 subcategories under Materialism, each housing seven to 14 specific theories. This makes sense in that there are more ways to explain consciousness with neurobiological and other physical models than with non-neurobiological and non-physical models, and also in that the challenge for materialism is to account for how the physical brain entails mental states (and there are increasingly innovative and diverse claims to do so).</p><p id="p0455">There is obvious overlap among categories and among theories within categories, and it is often challenging to pick distinguishing traits to classify theories in such a one-dimensional, artificial and imposed typology. For example, one can well argue that Non-Reductive Physicalism, Quantum Theories, and perhaps even Integrated Information Theory and Panpsychisms, are all, in essence, Materialism Theories, in that they do not require anything beyond the physical world (whether in current or extended form). I break out these categories because, in recent times, each has developed a certain independence, prominence and credibility (at least in the sense of the credulity of adherents), and because they differ sufficiently from classic Materialism Theories, exemplified by neurobiological mechanisms.</p><p id="p0460">In addition, the ideas of epiphenomenalism, functionalism and emergence, and the mechanisms of prediction and language models, while themselves not specific explanations of consciousness, represent core concepts in philosophy of mind that can affect some explanations and influence some implications.</p><p id="p0465">Some would impose an “entrance requirement” on the Landscape, such that theories admitted need be “scientific” in the sense that the scientific method should be applicable, whether in a formal Popperian falsification sense or with a weaker verification methodology. I do not subscribe to this limitation, although we must always distinguish between science and philosophy, along with other potential forms of knowledge. (My quasi-“Overton Window” of consciousness—the range of explanatory theories I feel comfortable presenting, if not propounding—may be wider than those of others, whether physicalists or nonphysicalists<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn13" name="bfn13" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn13"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>13</sup></span></span></a> [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib51" name="bbib51" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib51"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Birth, 2023</span></span></a>]. One reason for my wider window is the unsolicited theories of consciousness I receive on <em>Closer To Truth</em>, some of which I find intriguing if not convincing.)</p><p id="p0470">The Landscape itself, as a one-dimensional typology, is limited and imperfect decisions must be made: which theories to include and which not; where to classify; what is the optimal order; whether to append a possessive name to the theory's title; and the like. I've tried to include all the well-known theories and an idiosyncratic selection of lesser-known theories that have some aspects of originality, rationality, coherence, and, well, charm. In addition, a few theories reflect the beliefs of common people, or the interests of <em>Closer To Truth</em> viewers, though largely dismissed by the scientific and philosophical communities. Some theories some think bizarre, “fabulous” in the original meaning of the word: “mythical, celebrated in fable.” All reflect the imaginations of the human mind driven by a quest to know reality. Please do not take the unavoidable appearance of visual equality among theories as indicating their truth-value equivalence (or, for that matter, my personal opinion of them).</p><p id="p0475">Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux (9.8.5; 9.10.2), noting “the broad nature” of the Landscape (on reviewing an early draft), suggests that “The Sniff Test” might be relevant.

Materialism theories</h2><p id="p0490">Materialism is the claim that consciousness is entirely physical, solely the product of biological brains, and all mental states can be fully “reduced” to, or wholly explained by, physical states—which, at their deepest levels, are the fields and particles of fundamental physics. In short, materialism, in its many forms and flavors, gives a completely physicalist account of phenomenal consciousness.</p><p id="p0495">Overwhelmingly for scientists, materialism is the prevailing theory of consciousness. To them, the utter physicality of consciousness is an assumed premise, supported strongly by incontrovertible empirical evidence from neuroscience (e.g., brain impairment, brain stimulation). This is “Biological Naturalism,” as exemplified by philosopher John Searle (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib688" name="bbib688" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib688"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Searle, 2007a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib689" name="bbib689" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib689"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2007b</span></span></a>).

To physicist Sean Carroll, consciousness is “a way of talking about the physical world, just like many other ways of talking. It's one of these emergent phenomena that we find is a useful way of packaging reality, so we say that someone is conscious of something that corresponds to certain physical actions in the real world.” Carroll is unambiguous: “I don't think that there is anything special about mental properties. I don't think there's any special mental realm of existence. I think it's all the physical world and all the manifold ways we have of describing it” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib115" name="bbib115" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib115"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carroll, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0510">Nobel laureate biologist Gerald Edelman agrees. He does not consider the real existence of qualia to be an insurmountable impediment to a thoroughly materialistic theory of consciousness. “To expect that a theoretical explanation of consciousness can itself provide an observer with the experience of ‘the redness of red’ is to ignore just those phenotypic properties and life history that enable an individual animal to know what it is like to be such an animal. A scientific theory cannot presume to replicate the experience that it describes or explains; a theory to account for a hurricane is not a hurricane. A third-person description by a theorist of the qualia associated with wine tasting can, for example, take detailed account of the reported personal experiences of that theorist and his human subjects. It cannot, however, directly convey or induce qualia by description; to experience the discriminations of an individual, it is necessary to be that individual” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib229" name="bbib229" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib229"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 2003</span></span></a>). While Edelman's honest assessment may give Materialism Theories their best shot, many remain unpersuaded. After all, still, we wonder: what are qualia? Literally, what are they!</p><p id="p0515">Even among philosophers, a majority are physicalists (but just barely). In their 2020 survey of professional philosophers, Bourget and Chalmers report 51.9% support Physicalism; 32.1%, Non-physicalism; and 15.9%, Other (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib82" name="bbib82" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib82"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bourget and Chalmers, 2023</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib81" name="bbib81" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib81"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bourget and Chalmers, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0520">Chalmers provides “roughly three ways that a materialist might resist the epistemic arguments” by mitigating the <em>epistemic gap</em> between the physical and phenomenal domains, where “each denies a certain sort of close epistemic relation between the domains: a relation involving what we can know, or conceive, or explain.” According to Chalmers, “A type-A materialist denies that there is the relevant sort of epistemic gap. A type-B materialist accepts that there is an unclosable epistemic gap, but denies that there is an ontological gap. And a type-C materialist accepts that there is a deep epistemic gap, but holds that it will eventually be closed” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib124" name="bbib124" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib124"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2003</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0525">A subtle way to think about Materialism Theories recruits the concept of “supervenience” in that “the mental supervenes on the physical” such that there cannot be a change in the mental without there being a change in the physical. One such subtlety is the modal force of the connection or dependency, parsing among logical necessity, metaphysical necessity, factual or empirical necessity, as well as among explanation, entailment, grounding, reduction, emergence, ontological dependence, and the like. For this Landscape of explanations of consciousness, we leave “supervenience” to others (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib532" name="bbib532" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib532"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McLaughlin and Bennett, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0530">Similarly, the relationship between introspection and consciousness is an intimate one, linking the epistemology of self-knowledge with the metaphysics of mind. For several theories of consciousness, introspection is essential (e.g., neurophenomenology, 9.6.4 and 9.6.5), though for most, it is a non-issue (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib718" name="bbib718" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib718"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Smithies and Stoljar, 2012</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0535">Two major theories of consciousness are Integrated Information Theory and Global Workspace Theory. Both are important, of course, and perhaps by situating them on the Landscape, they can be evaluated from different perspectives. In what may reflect my personal bias, I situate Global Workspace Theory under Materialism's Neurobiological Theories, while giving Integrated Information Theory its own first-order category.

Epiphenomenalism</h4><p id="p0615">In epiphenomenalism, consciousness is entirely physical, solely the product of biological brains, but mental states cannot be entirely reduced to physical states (brains or otherwise), and mental states have no causal powers. Constrained by the “causal closure of the physical,” the mind, whatever else it might be, is entirely inert: our awareness of consciousness is real, but our sense of mental causation is not. Consciousness is still a kind of illusion or trick in that there is no “top-down causation”; our sense that our thoughts can cause things is mistaken. In this manner, epiphenomenalism is a weaker form of non-reductive physicalism (10). All conscious mental events, including conscious perceptions, involve unconscious processing. The classic analogy for consciousness as an epiphenomenon is “foam on an ocean wave:” always there, apparently active, but never really doing anything.</p><p id="p0620">More formally, epiphenomenalism holds that phenomenal properties are ontologically distinct from physical properties, and that the phenomenal has no effect on the physical. Physical states cause phenomenal states, but not vice versa. The arrow of psychophysical causation points in only one direction, from physical to phenomenal (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib124" name="bbib124" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib124"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2003</span></span></a>).

In other theories of consciousness, mental causation will be less obvious but perhaps no less important.</p><p id="p0635">Daniel Stoljar notes that if phenomenal consciousness would be “merely an epiphenomenon with no causal force,” perhaps “this will end up being the best option for dualism 2.0 (15.10), despite its being counterintuitive—after all, it certainly seems to us that our phenomenally conscious states causally matter.

Reductive physicalism is true for the mind if both steps can always be carried out.” Block makes the at-first counterintuitive claim that reductive physicalism and functionalism are “incompatible rivals,” explaining that when understood as metaphysical theses, “appearances to the contrary stem from failure to sufficiently appreciate the upshot of the difference between metaphysics and ontology”—in that functionalism is agnostic on the existence of nonphysical substances (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib70" name="bbib70" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib70"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Block, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0665">David Chalmers uses a silicon-chip-replacement thought experiment to support a functional approach to consciousness.<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn16" name="bfn16" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn16"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>16</sup></span></span></a> “When experience arises from a physical system,” he says, “it does so in virtue of the system's <em>functional organization</em>.” The thought experiment replaces brain neurons with microchips that can duplicate 100% of the neuron's functions, and to do so slowly, even one by one.

Reductionism is mainstream science, the bedrock assumption of the scientific method: All, in principle, can be explained by physics, even if all, in practice, cannot be.</p><p id="p0695">Davies defines “ontological reductionism” as the state of affairs where all reality “is, in the final analysis, nothing but the sum of the parts, and that the formulation of concepts, theories, and experimental procedures in terms of higher-level concepts is merely a convenience.” (He distinguishes “methodological reductionism,” where reductionism is a “fruitful methodology,” from “epistemological reductionism” where all we can know is that reductionism works by explaining one scientific level in terms of lower or more fundamental levels, without making any claim on ultimate reality.)

As Davies explains, “Strong emergence is a far more contentious position, in which it is asserted that the micro-level principles are quite simply inadequate to account for the system's behaviour as a whole. Strong emergence cannot succeed in systems that are causally closed at the microscopic level, because there is no room for additional principles to operate that are not already implicit in the lower-level rules.” He posits only three “loopholes”: the universe is an open system, non-deterministic quantum mechanics, and computational imprecision at fundamental levels—all three have obvious problems, which is why they are “considered unorthodox departures from standard physical theory” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib189" name="bbib189" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib189"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Davies, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0715">David Chalmers says that “a high-level phenomenon is <em>strongly emergent</em> with respect to a low-level domain when the high-level phenomenon arises from the low-level domain, but truths concerning that phenomenon are not <em>deducible</em> even in principle from truths in the low-level domain.” He distinguishes a high-level phenomenon that is “<em>weakly</em> emergent with respect to a low-level domain when the high-level phenomenon arises from the low-level domain, but truths concerning that phenomenon are unexpected given the principles governing the low-level domain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib126" name="bbib126" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib126"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0720">Strong emergence, Chalmers contends, has “radical consequences,” such that “If there are phenomena that are strongly emergent with respect to the domain of physics, then our conception of nature needs to be expanded to accommodate them.

His approach is to ignore the mind-body problem's philosophical history and focus on “what you know for a fact.” He starts with a mundane, working definition of consciousness: “Conscious states are those states of awareness, sentience or feeling that begin in the morning when we wake from a dreamless sleep and continue throughout the day until we fall asleep or otherwise become ‘unconscious’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib689" name="bbib689" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib689"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Searle, 2007b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib690" name="bbib690" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib690"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Searle, 2014a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0750">Searle identifies four essential features of consciousness: “1. Conscious states, so defined, are qualitative, in the sense that there is a qualitative feel to being in any particular conscious state …. 2. Such conscious states are also ontologically subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by a human or animal subject …. 3. Furthermore, a striking fact, at any moment in your conscious life, all of your conscious states are experienced by you as part of a single unified conscious field …. 4. Most, but not all, conscious states are intentional, in the philosopher's sense that they are about, or refer to, objects and states of affairs.”<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn17" name="bfn17" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn17"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>17</sup></span></span></a></p><p id="p0755">Next is crucial: “The reality and irreducibility of consciousness: Conscious states, so defined, are real parts of the real world and cannot be eliminated or reduced to something else.” This means that one cannot do an ontological reduction of consciousness to more fundamental neurobiological processes, because, as stated, consciousness has a subjective or a first-person ontology, while the neurobiological causal basis of consciousness has an objective or third person ontology (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib689" name="bbib689" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib689"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Searle, 2007b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0760">The causal reducibility of consciousness leads to Searle's major move: “The neuronal basis of consciousness: All conscious states are caused by lower-level brain processes.” Not knowing all the details of exactly how consciousness is caused by brain processes casts “no doubt that it is in fact.” Searle asserts with confidence, “The thesis that all of our conscious states, from feeling thirsty to experiencing mystical ecstasies, are caused by brain processes is now established by an overwhelming amount of evidence (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib689" name="bbib689" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib689"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Searle, 2007b</span></span></a>).

Consciousness is taken to name a set of processes, not a thing or a mental faculty.” The theory is neo-Darwinian, he says, “in that it is committed to the view that the capacity to experience things evolved via the processes responsible for the development of our nervous system.” The theory, he stresses, “denies that consciousness is as consciousness seems at the surface.” Rather, consciousness has a complex structure, and getting at it requires “coordination of phenomenological, psychological, and neural analyses” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib255" name="bbib255" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib255"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Flanagan, 1993</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0810">Flanagan explains that “there is no necessary connection between how things seem and how they are … [and] we are often mistaken in our self-reporting, including in our reporting about how things seem.” This is why he cautions that phenomenology might do “more harm than good when it comes to developing a proper theory of consciousness, since it fosters certain illusions about the nature of consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib255" name="bbib255" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib255"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Flanagan, 1993</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0815">“The most plausible hypothesis,” Flanagan states, “is that the mind is the brain, a Darwin machine that is a massively well-connected system of parallel processors interacting with each other from above and below, and every which way besides.” It is no wonder, he says, that “meaning holism is true, that we somehow solve the frame problem, and that my belief that snow is white is realized quite possibly in a somewhat different way in my brain than the same belief is realized in yours.”</p><p id="p0820">Flanagan addresses “the gap between the first-person way in which conscious mental life reveals itself and the way it is, or can be described, from an objective point of view” by asserting bluntly, “mind and brain are one and the same thing seen from two different perspectives.

For example, we might observe that pains occur whenever prefrontal nociceptive-specific neurons fire, and vice versa; we might also note that, if pains were the firing of nociceptive-specific neurons, then this would account for a number of other observed facts about pain, such as that it can be caused by trapped nerves, and can be blocked by aspirin; and we might conclude on this basis that pains are indeed identical to the firing of nociceptive-specific neurons.” Papineau singles out “the peculiarly direct nature of our concepts of conscious states” as what “stops us deriving mind-brain identities a priori from the physical facts.”</p><p id="p0860">In exploring the basis of identity claims, Papineau states “it can only be on the basis of an abductive inference from direct empirical evidence, such as that the two things in question are found in the same places and the same times, and are observed to bear the same relations to other things, not because we can deduce the identities a priori from the physical facts.” His examples include “Cary Grant = Archie Leach”, and “that dog = her pet.” “Why shouldn't this same way of thinking be applied to consciousness, he asks?” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib596" name="bbib596" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib596"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Papineau, 2020b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0865">Because, he answers, “even after we are given all the abductive evidence, we still find mind-brain identity claims almost impossible to believe. We cannot resist the dualist conviction that conscious feelings and the physical brain states are two different things.” And this, in Papineau's view, “is the real reason why we feel a need for further explanation. We want to know why the neuronal activity is accompanied by <em>that</em> conscious feeling, rather than by some other, or by no feeling at all. Our dualist intuitions automatically generate a hankering for further explanation.” Thus, Papineau concludes, “the demand for explanation arises, not because something is lacking in physicalism, but because something is lacking in us.”</p><p id="p0870">“If only we could fully embrace physicalism,” Papineau suggests, “the feeling of an explanatory gap would disappear. If we could fully accept that pains are nociceptive-specific neuronal firing, then we would stop asking why ‘they’ go together—after all, nothing can possibly come apart from itself.”</p><p id="p0875">To Papineau, this kind of robust physicalism can dissolve “the problem of consciousness”. The move is to “simply deny that any puzzle is raised by the fact that it feels painful to be a human with active nociceptive-neurons. Why shouldn't it feel like that? That's how it turns out. Why regard this as puzzling?” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib595" name="bbib595" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib595"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Papineau, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0880">An insight is the connotation of verbs used to describe the relation between mind and brain. Brain processes are said to “generate”, or “yield”, or “cause”, or “give rise to” conscious states. But this phraseology, Papineau says, undermines physicalism from the start—even when used by physicalists. As he puts it, “Fire ‘generates’, ‘causes’, ‘yields’ or ‘gives rise to’ smoke. But NaCl doesn't ‘generate’, ‘cause’, ‘yield’ or ‘give rise to’ salt. It <em>is</em> salt. The point is clear. To speak of brain processes as ‘generating’ conscious states, and so on, only makes sense if you are implicitly thinking of the conscious states as separate from the brain states” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib596" name="bbib596" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib596"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Papineau, 2020b</span></span></a>).

Papineau rightly states that physicalists must deny that zombies are possible, “given that the mind is ontologically inseparable from the brain.” If conscious states <em>are</em> physical states—radically identical—then, he says, “the ‘two’ cannot come apart,” much like Marilyn Monroe cannot exist without Norma Jean Baker.

Hardcastle's argument against materialism skeptics</h4><p id="p0935">Philosopher Valerie Gray Hardcastle argues that the points of division between materialists and materialism-skeptics “are quite deep and turn on basic differences in understanding the scientific enterprise.” This disagreement, “the rifts,” which she frames, in part, between David Chalmers and herself, concerns whether consciousness is a brute fact about the world, which materialists deny and its skeptics affirm. Rather, materialists believe that consciousness is part of the physical world, just like everything else. “It is completely nonmysterious (though it is poorly understood) [and materialists] have total and absolute faith that science as it is construed today will someday explain this as it has explained the other so-called mysteries of our age” (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib340" name="bbib340" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib340"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hardcastle, 1996</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0940">Hardcastle gives her clear-eyed assessment: “I am a committed materialist and believe absolutely and certainly that empirical investigation is the proper approach in explaining consciousness. I also recognize that I have little convincing to say to those opposed to me. There are few useful conversations; there are even fewer converts.” She epitomizes the skeptics' position: “Isolating the causal relations associated with conscious phenomena would simply miss the boat, for there is no way that doing that ever captures the qualitative aspects of awareness. What the naturalists might do is illustrate <em>when</em> we are conscious, but that won't explain the <em>why</em> of consciousness.” Thus, she continues, whatever the neural correlate(s) of consciousness may be, the naturalists would not have explained why it is <em>that</em> (or <em>those</em>). Part of a good explanation, skeptics maintain, “is making the identity statement (or whatever) intelligible, plausible, reasonable” and this is what materialists have not done and thus have not closed the explanatory gap.</p><p id="p0945">In response, Hardcastle is frank: “To them, I have little to say in defence of naturalism, for I think nothing that I as an already committed naturalist could say would suffice, for we don't agree on the terms of the argument in the first place.” The consciousness identity, whatever it turns out to be, could be a brute fact about the world, just like the laws of physics. At some point, in all theories, explanations must end. Hardcastle asks, “How do I make my identification of consciousness with some neural activity intelligible to those who find it mysterious? My answer is that I don't. The solution to this vexing difficulty, such as it is, is all a matter of attitude. That is, the problem itself depends on the spirit in which we approach an examination of consciousness.” In characterizing “consciousness-mysterians,” she states, “They are antecedently convinced of the mysteriousness of consciousness and no amount of scientific data is going to change that perspective. Either you already believe that science is going to give you a correct identity statement, or you don't and you think that there is always going to be something left over, the phenomenal aspects of conscious experience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib340" name="bbib340" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib340"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hardcastle, 1996</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0950">Hardcastle's advice to skeptics? “Consciousness-mysterians need to alter their concepts. To put it bluntly: their failure to appreciate the world as it really is cuts no ice with science. Their ideas are at fault, not the scientific method. Materialists presume that there is some sort of identity statement for consciousness. (Of course, we don't actually have one yet, but for those of us who are not consciousness-mysterians, we feel certain that one is in the offing.) Hence, the skeptics can't really imagine possible worlds in which consciousness is not whatever we ultimately discover it to be because they aren't imagining consciousness in those cases (or, they aren't imagining properly). But nevertheless, what can I say to those who insist that they can imagine consciousness as beyond science's current explanatory capacities? I think nothing …”</p><p id="p0955">The fundamental difference between materialists and their skeptics, according to Hardcastle, is that “Materialists are trying to explain to each other what consciousness is within current scientific frameworks … If you don't antecedently buy into this project …, then a naturalist's explanation probably won't satisfy you. It shouldn't. But that is not the fault of the explanation, nor is it the fault of the materialists.

He defines physicalism as the thesis that "every instantiated property is either physical or is necessitated by some physical property," where physical property is described by “all and only the following elements: it is a) a distinctive property of intuitively physical objects, b) expressed by a predicate of physics, c) objective, d) knowable through scientific investigation, and e) not a distinctive property of souls, ectoplasm, etc.” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib552" name="bbib552" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib552"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Montero, 2012</span></span></a>). According to Stoljar, "Physicalism has no formulations on which it is both true and deserving of the name"—but this “does not entail that philosophical problems stated in terms of it [physicalism] have no reasonable formulation” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib737" name="bbib737" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib737"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stoljar, 2010</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib552" name="bbib552" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib552"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Montero, 2012</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p0970">As everyone knows, the philosophical problem of phenomenal consciousness is the poster-child test case for physicalism, the standard physicalist framework being that “consciousness can be explained by contemporary physics, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, p. i). To Stoljar, the problem (or problems) of consciousness is “whether two big ideas can both be true together. The first is the existence of consciousness. The second is a worldview (a picture of everything that exists) that many people think you must believe if you hold a vaguely scientific or rational approach to the world, namely, physicalism.” Stoljar calls it the “compatibility problem”— “i.e., the problem of whether physicalism and claim that consciousness exists can both be correct”—and he says that the solution is “right under our nose.” The solution to the compatibility problem, Stoljar tells us, “is that we are missing something”—and the depth and implications of this simple statement are surprisingly profound (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 64–65).</p><p id="p0975">What we are missing, according to Stoljar, “is a type of physical fact or property relevant to consciousness. More than this, we are profoundly ignorant of the nature of the physical world, and ignoring this ignorance is what generates the problem.” He calls “the idea that we are ignorant of a type of fact or property that is relevant to consciousness the <em>ignorance hypothesis</em>” and he calls “the idea that the ignorance hypothesis solves the compatibility problem the <em>epistemic view.</em>” Stoljar contends that all arguments for the opposing view—i.e., that physicalism and consciousness are incompatible—“fail, and for a single reason.” These arguments, he says, “all presuppose that we have complete knowledge of the physical facts relevant to consciousness. According to the epistemic view, that presupposition is false, so the arguments [against physicalism-consciousness compatibility] don't work.” That physicalism cannot be shown affirmatively to be true does not bother Stoljar, because, he says, physicalism is an empirical truth, not an a priori argument. “What the epistemic view says is that … there is no persuasive ‘here and now’ argument for incompatibility.” Thus, Stoljar argues, the epistemic view helps us think about the problems of consciousness in a clearer way, disentangling them from the compatibility problem (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 64–66).</p><p id="p0980">Stoljar is no traditional physicalist. He critiques “standard physicalism,” by which he means “versions of physicalism that make no theoretical use of the ignorance hypothesis.” He conjectures that there are properties of the physical world that go beyond the capacity of the physical sciences to access and measure through its devices and instruments. Is this incapacity in practice, as per current science, or in principle, such that ultimate truth is forever out of reach? Who knows?

Edelman's neural Darwinism and reentrant neural circuitry</h4><p id="p0995">Nobel laureate biologist Gerald Edelman presents a purely biological theory of consciousness, founded on Darwinian natural selection and complex brain morphology.

Such repertoires of variant circuits are degenerate, i.e., structurally different circuit variants within this selectional system can carry out the same function or produce the same output. Subsequent to their incorporation into anatomical repertoires during development, circuit variants that match novel signals are differentially selected through changes in synaptic efficacy. Differential amplification of selected synaptic populations in groups of neurons increases the likelihood that, in the future, adaptive responses of these groups will occur following exposure to similar signals” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib229" name="bbib229" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib229"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 2003</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1005">Edelman's way of thinking is motivated by his work on the immune system (for which he was awarded the Nobel) and his theory is developed in two domains: Neural Darwinism (neural group selection) and Dynamic Core (reentrant neural circuitry).</p><p id="p1010">Neural Darwinism is “the idea that higher brain functions are mediated by developmental and somatic selection upon anatomical and functional variance occurring in each individual animal” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib228" name="bbib228" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib228"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 1989</span></span></a>). Neural Darwinism has two aspects: (i) development selection, which controls the gross anatomy and microstructure of the brain, allowing for great variability in the neural circuitry; and (ii) experiential selection, especially of the synaptic structure where functional plasticity is essential given the vast number of synapses (estimated at over 100 trillion, possibly 600 trillion or more). Edelman notes that a child's brain contains many more neural connections than will ultimately survive to maturity—estimates go as high as 1000 trillion—and he argues that this redundant capacity, this functional plasticity, is needed because “neurons are the only cells in the body that cannot be renewed and because only those networks best adapted to their ultimate purpose will be selected as they organize into neuronal groups” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib230" name="bbib230" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib230"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 2024</span></span></a>).

Higher-order consciousness allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of primary consciousness.

Edelman's proposal is as follows. “At some time around the divergence of reptiles into mammals and then into birds, the embryological development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich reentrant activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory. This reentrant activity provided the neural basis for integration of a scene with all of its entailed qualia … [which] conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib229" name="bbib229" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib229"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 2003</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1050">In summary, according to Edelman, “consciousness arises as a result of integration of many inputs by reentrant interactions in the dynamic core. This integration occurs in periods of &lt;500 ms. Selection occurs among a set of circuits in the core repertoire; given their degeneracy, a number of different circuits can carry out similar functions. As a result of the continual interplay of signals from the environment, the body, and the brain itself, each integrated core state is succeeded by yet another and differentiated neural state in the core … The sequences and conjoined arrays of qualia entailed by this neural activity are the higher-order discriminations that such neural events make possible. Underlying each quale are distinct neuroanatomical structures and neural dynamics that together account for the specific and distinctive phenomenal property of that quale. Qualia thus reflect the causal sequences of the underlying metastable neural states of the complex dynamic core” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib229" name="bbib229" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib229"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 2003</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1055">Finally, Edelman addresses the hard problem. “The fact that it is only by having a phenotype capable of giving rise to those qualia that their ‘quality’ can be experienced is not an embarrassment to a scientific theory of consciousness. Looked at in this way, the so-called hard problem is ill posed, for it seems to be framed in the expectation that, for an observer, a theoretical construct can lead by description to the experiencing of the phenomenal quality being described. If the phenomenal part of conscious experience that constitutes its entailed distinctions is irreducible, so is the fact that physics has not explained why there is something rather than nothing. Physics is not hindered by this ontological limit nor should the scientific understanding of consciousness be hindered by the privacy of phenomenal experience.” Edelman is confident. “At the end of our studies, when we have grasped its mechanisms in greater detail, consciousness will lose its mystery and be generally accepted as part of the natural order” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib229" name="bbib229" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib229"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edelman, 2003</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1060">Personally, I like analogizing the something/nothing ontological limit in physics to the phenomenal consciousness psychophysical privacy limit in neuroscience—the two ultimate questions of existence and sentience. But I hesitate to draw the analogy too tightly. Something/nothing is a kind of historical question of <em>what happened</em>, that is, explaining the hypothetical <em>process</em>. For example, it could be that nothing is in principle impossible. Phenomenal consciousness is a clearly contemporary question of <em>what is</em>, that is, explaining the actual <em>thing</em>. Moreover, I agree that even with its something/nothing ontological limit, physics can do its work, as with its phenomenal consciousness privacy limit, neuroscience can do its work. But that work, remember, constitutes the “easy problems.”</p></section><section id="sec9.2.2"><h4 id="sectitle0140" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.2.2. Crick and Koch's neural correlates of consciousness (NCC)</h4><p id="p1065">The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) is defined as the minimum activities in the brain jointly sufficient (and probably necessary) for any one specific conscious perception, and, extended, for subjective experience in general, the inner awareness of qualia. Originally applied to sleep and wakefulness (i.e., the reticular activating system in the brain stem), the NCC were formally proposed by Francis Crick and Christof Koch as a scientific approach to what had been believed to be the vague, metaphysical and somewhat discredited idea of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib175" name="bbib175" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib175"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Crick and Koch, 1990</span></span></a>), a program then championed by Koch (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib452" name="bbib452" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib452"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Koch, 2004</span></span></a>, <em>Closer To Truth</em>) and others (though Koch has become something of a “romantic reductionist” [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib453" name="bbib453" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib453"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Koch, 2012a</span></span></a>]).</p><p id="p1070">While there are complex methodological issues, NCC mechanisms include neuronal electrophysiological action potentials (spikes), their frequencies and sequences; neurochemical transmitter flows in the synapses between neurons; and recurrent brain circuits in specific brain areas. An example is clusters of neurons that underlie wakefulness in the brainstem connecting to clusters of neurons in the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex related to awareness/consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib838" name="bbib838" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib838"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wong, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8660">Similarly, a "default ascending arousal network" (dANN) has been proposed, with subcortical nodes in the brainstem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and basal forebrain (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib855" name="bbib855" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib855"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Edlow, 2024</span></span></a>).

The result is a cacophony of sounds.” In the absence of the claustra in both cerebral hemispheres, attributes such as sensory modalities “may not be experienced in an integrated manner and the subject may fail to altogether perceive these objects or events or only be consciously aware of some isolated attribute.” This would mean, they suggest, “that different attributes of objects … are rapidly combined and bound in the claustrum” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib176" name="bbib176" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib176"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Crick and Koch, 2005</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1080">A more recent candidate for full and content-specific NCC is located in the posterior cerebral cortex, in a temporo-parietal-occipital hot zone (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib458" name="bbib458" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib458"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Koch et al., 2016</span></span></a>), though no one is yelling “Eureka” and the search continues.

GWT is founded on the concept of an inner “theater of consciousness,” where the mental spotlight of awareness shines on sequential sets of integrated perceptions that are dominant, at least momentarily. (The global workspace “Theater of Consciousness” is said not to contradict Dennett's rejected “Cartesian Theater,” because the former is not dualistic and does not reside in only one location in the brain; rather, the Theater of Consciousness is passive not active and is spread across much of the brain.)</p><p id="p1105">GWT holds that conscious mental states are those which are “globally available” to a wide range of brain processes including attention, perception, assessment, memory, verbal description, and motor response. Which sets of integrated perceptions become dominant, move to centerstage, and thus leap into conscious awareness? It's a competition. Diverse data flows originating both within the brain (e.g., memories) and from external stimuli (i.e., sensory information) are in constant competition, such that the “winner” is broadcast broadly (i.e., globally) in the brain and becomes accessible throughout the brain, which is how we become aware of it as the content of our consciousness.</p><p id="p1110">This brain-wide focus on a particular phenomenological package integrates all the relevant sensory and cognitive streams by recruiting all the relevant brain areas into an organic whole—while inhibiting other, extraneous, conflicting data flows—such that what resides in the global workspace is perceived as consciousness “snapshots” in continuous, movie-like motion. This means that while our conscious awareness may seem unified and seamless, in fact it is neither.</p><p id="p1115">Whereas GWT started in the 1980s as a purely psychological theory of conscious cognition, it has become a “family” of theories adapted to today's far more detailed understanding of the brain. The brain-based version of GWT is called Global Workspace Dynamics because the cortex is viewed as a “unified oscillatory machine”. GWT, therefore, according to its advocates, joins other theories in taking consciousness as the product of highly integrated and widespread cortico-thalamic activity, including evidence that the prefrontal cortex participates in the visual conscious stream. Cortex is extraordinarily flexible in its dynamic recruitment of different regions for different tasks. Therefore, an arbitrary division between prefrontal and other neuronal regions is said to be misleading. Consciousness requires a much broader, more integrative view (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib30" name="bbib30" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib30"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Baars et al., 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1120">In a pioneering set of “adversarial collaboration” experiments to test hypotheses of consciousness by getting rival researchers to collaborate on the study design,<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn19" name="bfn19" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn19"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>19</sup></span></span></a> preliminary results did not perfectly match GWT's prediction that consciousness arises when information is broadcast to areas of the brain through an interconnected network.

But independent “theory-neutral” researchers found that only some aspects of consciousness, but not all of them, could be identified in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, while they found evidence of brain broadcasting, the core of GWT, it was only at the beginning of an experience—not also at the end, as had been predicted.

Dennett's multiple drafts model</h4><p id="p1125">In his intellectual memoirs, <em>I've Been Thinking,</em> philosopher Daniel Dennett highlights two fundamental questions on which his career is founded—the two related philosophical problems he set himself to solve. “First, how can it be that some complicated clumps of molecules can be properly described as having states or events that are <em>about something</em>, that have meaning or content. And second, how can it be that at least some of these complicated clumps of molecules are conscious—that is, aware that they are gifted with states or events that are about something?” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib208" name="bbib208" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib208"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dennett, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib209" name="bbib209" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib209"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1130">In dealing with these questions, Dennett realized, way back in his PhD dissertation in 1965, that “the best—and only—way of making sense of the mind and consciousness is through evolution by natural selection on many levels.” Dennett's core insight subsuming biological evolution in general and the development of mind in particular is concise: reasons without a reasoner, design without a designer, and competence without comprehension (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib205" name="bbib205" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib205"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dennett, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1135">Dennett's theory of consciousness is distinguished by four ideas: (i) there is no “Cartesian Theater,” no inner witness viewing the consciousness show; (ii) different brain regions or modules develop different kinds of content, which Dennett calls “multiple drafts”; (iii) the multiple drafts compete with one another for attention, the winner of the winner-take-all competition occupying the entirety of the conscious moment, which Dennett calls “fame in the brain”; and (iv) the collection of all these conscious moments coalesces into a kind of life story, the emergence of a sense of “self,” which Dennett describes as a “center of narrative gravity.”</p><p id="p1140">In <em>Consciousness Explained,</em> Dennett presents his multiple drafts model of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib203" name="bbib203" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib203"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dennett, 1992</span></span></a>). He states that all varieties of perception, thought, or mental activity are processed in the brain via parallel, multitrack interpretations and elaborations, subject to continuous "editorial revision.” These “yield, over the course of time, something <em>rather like</em> a narrative stream or sequence, the product of continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain.” Dennett has the brain consisting of a "bundle of semi-independent agencies," and his metaphor “fame in the brain” tells us what it takes for competing ideas to determine the content of consciousness at any given moment.</p><p id="p1145">In supporting his theory, Dennett needs to undermine what we take to be common sense. He challenges the verisimilitude of inner experience, which he calls more like theorizing than like describing. He rejects the notion of a single central location (his "Cartesian theater") where conscious experience can be “viewed.” He dissolves the idea of the “self” as the central character of stories made up by content fixation and propagation in the brain. Moreover, he argues that the properties of qualia are incompatible and therefore incoherent, thus obviating the need to solve Chalmers's hard problem.<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn20" name="bfn20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>20</sup></span></span></a> Dennett needs all four of these counterintuitive yet deeply probative assertions; the package is admirably coherent, but buying it is a tall order.</p><p id="p1150">Of Dennett's four assertions, his desired demolition of qualia is perhaps his most critical move.

They are perfectly real illusions! They just aren't what they seem to be; they are not intrinsic, unanalyzable properties of mental states; they are highly structured and complex activated neural networks that dispose us to do all sorts of things in response—such as declare that we're seeing something blue.

The key fact is that “<em>you don't know anything ‘privileged’ about the causation of your own thoughts</em>. You cannot know ‘from the inside” what events cause you to think you see something as red or green, for instance, or cause you to push button A instead of button B.” In short, to truly understand consciousness, Dennett says “you need to go outside yourself and adopt the ‘third-person point of view’ of science” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib208" name="bbib208" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib208"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dennett, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib209" name="bbib209" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib209"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1165">Dennett stresses the importance of treating subjects' <em>beliefs</em> about their own consciousness as “data to be explained, not necessarily as true accounts of mental reality.” He states, “This is <em>the</em> major fault line in philosophy of mind today, with John Searle, Tom Nagel, David Chalmers, Galen Strawson, and Philip Goff [all represented in this paper], among others, thinking they can just insist they know better. They don't. Those who object, who hold out for some sort of ‘first-person science of consciousness,’ have yet to describe any experiments or results that are trustworthy but unobtainable by heterophenomenology” (the term Dennett coined for the third-person method, the phenomenology of <em>other</em> minds, which is standard procedure in cognitive science). Dennett says his meeting with leading scientific researchers on consciousness enabled him “to begin to form at least vague ideas of how mechanisms of the brain might do all the work,” but only, he insists, “if we deflated some of the overconfident pronouncements of introspectors about the marvels of the phenomena” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib208" name="bbib208" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib208"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dennett, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib209" name="bbib209" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib209"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1170">In describing his early book, <em>Content and Consciousness</em>, where he puts content before consciousness, Dennett differentiates himself from John Searle, who puts consciousness before content.

It directs attention, provides executive function by changing the activity and parameterization and rewards of other cortical structures, and integrates aspects of the processes that it attended to into a protocol. This protocol is used for reflection and learning” (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib31" name="bbib31" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib31"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bach, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1300">Bach has CTC's “elementary agents” as columns in the cerebral cortex that “self-organize into the larger organizational units of the brain areas as a result of developmental reinforcement learning.

Whereas most cortical instruments, he says, “regulate the dynamics and interaction of the organism with the environment (or anticipated, reflected and hypothetical environments), the conductor regulates the dynamics of the orchestra itself.” The process is based on signals of the motivational system and it provides executive function, resolves conflicts between cortical agents, and regulates their activities (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib31" name="bbib31" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib31"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bach, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1305">“The conductor is the only place where experience is integrated,” Bach states. “Information that is not integrated in the protocol cannot become functionally relevant to the reflection of the system, to the production of its utterances, the generation of a cohesive self model, and it cannot become the object of access consciousness.” Without the conductor, he asserts, our brain can still perform most of its functions, but we would be “sleepwalkers, capable of coordinated perceptual and motor action, but without central coherence and reflection.”</p><p id="p1310">Memories empower Bach's theory. “Memories can be generated by reactivating a cortical configuration via the links and parameters stored at the corresponding point in the protocol. Reflective access to the protocol is a process that can itself be stored in the protocol, and by accessing this, a system may remember having had experiential access.” For phenomenal consciousness, Bach claims “it is necessary and sufficient that a system can access the memory of having had an experience—the actuality of experience itself is irrelevant.”</p><p id="p1315">Phenomenal consciousness, according to Bach, “may simply be understood as the most recent memory of what our prefrontal cortex attended to. Thus, conscious experience is not an experience of being in the world, or in an inner space, but a memory.

This is like taking one smaller Russian doll out and consider it in isolation from all the others (and, even worse, forgetting that any of the others were ever present).” If, in contrast, they suggest, “one conceives the spatiotemporal scale of mental features in the larger context of other spatiotemporal scales, one can take into view their nestedness.” In this view, Northoff has mental features as “nothing but a small Russian doll that is nested within the longer and more extended scales of the brain's spontaneous activity (which, by itself, is nested within the yet much larger spatiotemporal scales of body and world)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib584" name="bbib584" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib584"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Northoff et al., 2020</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.2.13"><h4 id="sectitle0195" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.2.13.

This would entail inter-brain rather than the normal intra-brain coupling. Then the first person might correctly say, “Wow, I am experiencing your conscious visual states.

The greater the severity of the injury, the greater the number and frequency of action potentials, and the greater the intensity of pain.</p><p id="p1495">The pain pathway is well documented: from periphery to spinal cord to the thalamus, where we first become aware of the injury but do not feel the affect of onerous pain. Rather, the region for feeling the hurtfulness of pain is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where input from the thalamus activates a complex neuronal circuit. Essential are the pyramidal neurons, which have a triangular cell body and a long dendrite with many branches that are vital for experiencing pain.</p><p id="p1500">Because information transmitted between neurons must traverse the minuscule space between them—the synapse—axons from thalamic neurons transmit to dendrites of ACC neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that traverses the gap, binds to the dendritic endings and triggers action potentials. When there is prolonged activity at the synapse in response to a serious injury, the synapses become “hyperresponsive” and strengthened. This strengthening, called long-term potentiation (LTP), sensitizes the synapse so that it takes fewer action potentials to cause pain. This is why even a gentle touch to the site of an injury will hurt (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib11" name="bbib11" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib11"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ambron, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib12" name="bbib12" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib12"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib13" name="bbib13" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib13"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ambron and Sinav, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1505">In addition to housing circuits for pain, the ACC receives information from other brain regions. For example, inputs from the amygdala can increase the intensity of the pain due to anxiety or fear, whereas those from the nucleus accumbens can reduce the pain if the reward for bearing the pain is considered worthwhile. Thus, what we experience as pain depends on interactions among several areas of the brain.</p><p id="p1510">To maintain electro-neutrality after an injury, there is an efflux of positive ions from the cell body that forms a local field potential (LFP) and creates electromagnetic (EM) waves in the extracellular space around the pyramidal neurons. In Ambron's novel move, he posits that these EM waves now contain the information about the pain that was previously encoded in the action potentials. In other words, the pain information was transferred from action potentials to LFPs to EM waves, which could influence nearby circuits, such as those for attention.</p><p id="p1515">Ambron speculates that these EM waves contribute to consciousness.

According to Zhang, neural action potentials in human brain circuits produce clusters of traveling electrical fields. Those with similar frequency tend to be synchronized.

Grossberg's idea is that the mind is an activity, not a thing, a verb not a noun—it's what you do, not what you have or use. His theoretical foundation is “Adaptive Resonance Theory” (ART), a cognitive and neural concept of how the brain autonomously learns to consciously attend, learn, categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib330" name="bbib330" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib330"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Grossberg, 2013</span></span></a>).

Consciousness thus enables learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony during both unsupervised and supervised learning. These mechanistic links arise from basic properties of brain design principles such as complementary computing, hierarchical resolution of uncertainty, and adaptive resonance. These principles, recursively, require conscious states to mark perceptual and cognitive representations that are complete, context sensitive, and stable enough to control effective actions (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib332" name="bbib332" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib332"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Grossberg, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1610">Foundational to Grossberg's way of thinking is the idea that all biological processes, notably our brains, self-organize, and that all cellular systems illustrate variations of a universal developmental code.

This state allows the brain to optimize multiple information processing tasks, from carrying out computations to transmitting and storing information, all at the same time” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib41" name="bbib41" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib41"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Beggs, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1660">The Critical Brain Hypothesis traces its origin to physicist Per Bak, who suggests that “the brain exhibits ‘self-organized criticality,’ tuning to its critical point automatically. Its exquisitely ordered complexity and thinking ability arise spontaneously … from the disordered electrical activity of neurons.” Founding his ideas on statistical mechanics, Bak hypothesizes that, “like a sandpile, the network balances at its critical point, with electrical activity following a power law. So when a neuron fires, this can trigger an ‘avalanche’ of firing by connected neurons, and smaller avalanches occur more frequently than larger ones” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib590" name="bbib590" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib590"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ouellette, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1665">The same sense of a critical brain being “just right,” Beggs says, also explains why information storage, which is driven by the activation of groups of neurons called assemblies, can be optimized. “In a subcritical network, the connections are so weak that very few neurons are coupled together, so only a few small assemblies can form. In a supercritical network, the connections are so strong that almost all neurons are coupled together, which allows only one large assembly. In a critical network, the connections are strong enough for many moderately sized groups of neurons to couple, yet weak enough to prevent them from all coalescing into one giant assembly.

Pribram's holonomic brain theory</h4><p id="p1680">Neurosurgeon/neuroscientist Karl Pribram's Holonomic Brain Theory is the novel idea that human consciousness comes about via quantum effects in or between brain cells such that the brain acts as a holographic storage network (building on theories of holograms formulated by Dennis Gabor). (“Holonomic” refers to representations in a Hilbert phase space defined by both spectral and space-time coordinates.) (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib380" name="bbib380" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib380"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Holonomic brain theory, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1685">Holograms are three-dimensional images encoded on two-dimensional surfaces and Pribram's claim is that this counterintuitive capacity is fundamental in explaining consciousness. (There is precedent in that the holographic principle in quantum cosmology describes black hole entropy and information, with applications in string theory and quantum gravity [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib379" name="bbib379" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib379"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Holographic principle, 2024</span></span></a>].)</p><p id="p1690">Holograms are generated from patterns of interference produced by superimposed wavefronts, created by split beams of coherent radiation (i.e., lasers) that are recorded and later re-constructed. A prime characteristic is that every part of the stored information is distributed over the entire hologram. Even if most parts of the hologram are damaged, as long as any part of the hologram is large enough to contain the interference pattern, that part can recreate the entirety of the stored image (but if the image is too small it will be noisy, blurry)</p><p id="p1695">The application of holographic models to consciousness was inspired by this non-locality of information storage within the hologram. It was Karl Pribram who first noted the similarities between an optical hologram and memory storage in the human brain, extrapolating what psychologist Karl Lashley had discovered about the wide distribution of memory in the cerebral cortex of rats following diverse surgical lesions. Pribram had worked with Lashley on Lashley's engram experiments, which sought to determine exact locations of specific memories in primate brains by making small lesions. The surprising result was that these targeted extirpations had little effect on memory. In contrast, removing large areas of cortex caused multiple serious deficits in memory and cognitive function. The conclusion was a milestone in neuroscience: Memories are not stored in a single circuit or exact location, but were spread over the entirety of a neural network. Thus, according to Holonomic Brain Theory, memories are stored in holographic-like fashion within certain general regions, but stored non-locally within those regions. This enables the brain to maintain function and memory even after it is damaged. (This can explain why some children retain normal intelligence when large portions of their brains—in some cases, half—are removed.) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib380" name="bbib380" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib380"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Holonomic brain theory, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1700">More fundamentally, Holonomic Brain Theory conjectures that consciousness is formed by quantum events within or between neurons. This early theory of quantum consciousness, which Pribram developed initially with physicist David Bohm, combines quantum biology with holographic storage. Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which differ from the commonly accepted action potentials along axons and traversing synapses. These oscillations are waves and create wave interference patterns in which memory is encoded such that a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor. The remarkable result is that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network—a mechanism that maps well onto laser-generated holograms. Thus, Holonomic Brain Theory is said to enable distinctive features of consciousness, including the fast associative memory that connects different pieces of stored information and the non-locality of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a single location; there is no dedicated group or circuit of specific neurons) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib380" name="bbib380" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib380"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Holonomic brain theory, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1705">Although Holonomic Brain Theory has not come to threaten mainstream neuroscience, it has intriguing features that should be explored.

Doyle's experience recorder and reproducer</h4><p id="p1715">“Information Philosopher” Bob Doyle proposes the “Experience Recorder and Reproducer (ERR)” as an information model for the mind. He says that the mind, like software, is immaterial information, a human being “is not a machine, the brain is not a computer, and the mind is not <em>processing</em> digital information.” His proposal is that “a minimal primitive mind would need only to ‘play back’ past experiences that resemble any part of current experience, because “remembering past experiences has obvious relevance (survival value) for an organism.” However, beyond its survival value, “the ERR evokes the epistemological ‘meaning’ of information perceived in that it may be found in the past experiences that are reproduced by the ERR, when stimulated by a new perception that resembles past experiences in some way” (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib214" name="bbib214" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib214"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Doyle, n.d.b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1720">Without prior similar experience, new perceptions will be "meaningless." A conscious being is constantly recording information about its perceptions of the external world and most importantly for ERR, it is simultaneously recording its feelings. Experiential data such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations are recorded in a sequence in association with emotional states, such as pleasure and pain, fear and comfort levels, etc. This means that when the experiences are reproduced (played back in a temporal sequence), the accompanying emotions are once again felt, in synchronization. The capability of reproducing experiences is critical to <em>learning</em> from past experiences, so as to make them guides for action in future experiences.</p><p id="p1730">The ERR biological model has information stored in “neurons that have been wired together.” (Neuroscientist Donald Hebb said that "neurons that fire together wire together.”) The stored information does not get recalled or retrieved (as computers do) to create a representation that can be viewed. Doyle prefers to call the reproduction a “re-presentation” in that the ERR is simply presenting or “re-presenting" the original experience in all parts of the conscious mind connected by the neural assembly. Humans are conscious of our experiences because they are recorded in (and reproduced on demand from) the information structures in our brains. Mental information houses the content of an individual (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib214" name="bbib214" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib214"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Doyle, n.d.b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1735">ERR, Doyle says, also solves the "binding problem,” the unification of experience<em>,</em> because the sensory components are bound together when initially stored in the ERR (together with the accompanying emotion). They remain bound on playback. “They do not have to be assembled together by an algorithmic scheme.”</p><p id="p1740">Consciousness, Doyle says, can be defined in information terms as a property of an entity (usually a living thing but can also include computers and artificial intelligence) that reacts appropriately to the information (and particularly to changes in the information) in its environment. In the context of information philosophy, Doyle posits that the Experience Recorder and Reproducer can provide us with “<em>information consciousness</em>.”</p><p id="p1745">The treatment of information is said to link the physical and the phenomenal. Wherever there is a phenomenal state, it realizes an information state, which is also realized in the cognitive system of the brain. Conversely, for at least some physically realized information spaces, whenever an information state in that space is realized physically, it is also realized phenomenally. This leads Doyle to suppose that “this double life of information spaces corresponds to a duality at a deep level.” He even suggests that this “double realization” of information is the key to the fundamental connection between physical processes and conscious experience. If so, Doyle concludes, we might develop a truly fundamental theory of consciousness. And it may just be that information itself is fundamental (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib214" name="bbib214" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib214"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Doyle, n.d.b</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.4.7"><h4 id="sectitle0280" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.4.7.

Rather, it defines things as “their capacity for communicating or exchanging information with other things,” such that “things make their reality felt by communicating or exchanging information.” This means that information is “the relational glue that holds reality together” and “thus assumes primacy in informational realism” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib201" name="bbib201" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib201"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dembski, 2021</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib202" name="bbib202" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib202"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1755">A key move in dissolving the mind-body problem, according to Dembski, is to substitute information for perception under an informational realism framework, thereby giving the mind direct access to fundamental properties (9.8.10).

EIT uses the term “information” as exemplified by computer binary “values.” While associated with a physical state (e.g., a magnetic polarity) they are distinct from it. The system design allows the “value” to be deduced from the state. However, being not composed of matter or energy the value itself, as defined, cannot interact with or be detected by any device. Yet it is these values that underlie the computer's function. EIT proposes that brain function is based on comparable primitive information associated with neuronal states (Boyd, 2020).</p><p id="p1770">These basic units of information are of no use individually. In computers they are combined to form hierarchical levels of organization—bytes, subroutines and programs—which cannot be observed, but can be deduced using the coding systems used to create them. Each level has properties that do not exist in underlying levels: the “emergence” referred to in EIT. Brain functions are based on equivalent hierarchical, emergent phenomena which are equally non-detectable. This applies not just to consciousness, but to all functional brain phenomena. That, in an organic system, this generic approach can result in the remarkable properties of consciousness should come as no surprise.

Their prime criterion is that for a mathematical structure to be literally of conscious experience, rather than merely a tool to describe conscious experience, “there must be something in conscious experience that corresponds to that structure.” In simple terms, they say, such a mathematical structure consists of two building blocks: the first brings in one or more sets called the ‘domains’ of the structure, where the elements of sets correspond to aspects of conscious experiences. The second are relations or functions which are defined on the domains. The authors claim that this definition does not rely on any specific conception or aspects of conscious experience. Rather, it can work with any theory of consciousness in that “every conscious experience comes with a set of aspects,” whether holistic, irreducible approaches to qualia and phenomenal properties, or theories built on atomistic conceptions of consciousness such as multiple mind modules (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib451" name="bbib451" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib451"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kleiner and Ludwig, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1800">Mathematician Yucong Duan proposes a mathematically based “bug” theory of consciousness in that, with respect to consciousness, a bug is “not only a limitation in information processing, but also an illusion that leads human beings to create abstract and complete semantics and use them as tools” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib219" name="bbib219" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib219"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Duan and Gong, 2024a</span></span></a>).

The second approach, broadly described as predictive processing, starts instead from a foundation principle of how the brain works—in terms of prediction as a core principle underlying perception, action, and cognition, and therefore does not directly specify theories of consciousness.

In particular, Gregory incorporated “explicitly Bayesian concepts” into our understanding of how sensory data is combined with pre-existing beliefs ("priors") to modify and mold perceptions.

More specifically, his theory proposes that phenomenological properties of conscious experiences can be explained by computational aspects of different forms of perceptual prediction. A key instance of this is in the ability to account for differences between experiences of the world and experiences of the self.

The key idea is that the brain is a “prediction machine,” and that what we see, hear, and feel is nothing more than the brain's “best guess” of the causes of its sensory inputs. Because perceptual experience is determined by the content of the (top-down) predictions, and not by the (bottom-up) sensory signals, we never experience sensory signals themselves, we only ever experience interpretations of them. Thus, “what we actually perceive is a top-down, inside-out neuronal fantasy that is reined in by reality, not a transparent window onto whatever that reality may be.” Taking this idea seriously and seeking its implications, Seth proposes that the contents of consciousness are a kind of waking dream—the “controlled hallucination”—that is both more than and less than whatever the real world really is.

Damasio's homeostatic feelings and emergence of consciousness</h4><p id="p1855">Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio's perspective on consciousness is distinctive in a variety of ways. Crucially, the root process behind consciousness, he argues, is that of feelings related to the interior of complex organisms endowed with nervous systems. These feelings, which Damasio calls “homeostatic” to distinguish them from the feelings of emotions, continuously represents the ongoing state of the life of an organism in terms of how close or how far that state is from ideal, that ideal being <em>homeostasis</em> (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib181" name="bbib181" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib181"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Damasio and Damasio, 2023</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib182" name="bbib182" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib182"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2024</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib177" name="bbib177" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib177"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Damasio, 1999</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1860">Neuroanatomically, the homeostatic feeling representations are achieved by the interoceptive system which collects signals—via interoceptive axons in peripheral nerves and spinal and brainstem nuclei—from the entire spectrum of viscera, from smooth musculature to end organs. Interoception is distinct from exteroception in a number of ways, but quite importantly because it pertains to an internal, animated landscape. Feelings represent evolving, active states but the “describer”—the nervous system—happens to be located inside the organism being “described”, with the consequence that the describer and described can interact. Moreover, the interaction is facilitated by the fact that the interoceptive nervous system is especially open, given its primitive nature, which includes neurons without myelin, whose axons are open to receiving signals at any point in their course, away from synapses (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib181" name="bbib181" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib181"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Damasio and Damasio, 2023</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib182" name="bbib182" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib182"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1865">Other reasons why homeostatic feelings are distinct, according to Damasio, include (1) the fact that they are <em>naturally</em>, <em>spontaneously</em>, <em>informative;</em> and (2) that the information they provide is used to adjust the life process such that it may best correspond to ideal conditions. In brief, homeostatic feelings are regulatory because their spontaneous consciousness is used to achieve homeostasis and guarantee the continuation of life.</p><p id="p1870">Homeostatic feelings are the natural source of <em>experiences.</em> When they are combined with images generated by exteroceptive channels such as vision, they produce <em>subjectivity</em>.</p><p id="p1875">Thus, according to Damasio, homeostatic feelings are the core phenomena of consciousness. They are <em>spontaneously</em> conscious processes of hybrid nature, combining mental features and bodily features. Their presence informs the rest of the mind, e.g., the images that correspond to current perceptions or to perceptions retrieved from memory, that (1) life is ongoing inside a specific body/organism, and that (2) the life process is (or is not) operating within a range conducive to the continuation of life.

The other path has related consciousness to affective processes, specifically to feeling. ‘The cognitive path’ has seen consciousness as a complex and late arrival in biological history. It culminates in cognition writ large, e.g. exteroceptive processes, memory, reasoning, symbolic languages, and creativity.

The feelings that translate fundamental homeostatic states—hunger, thirst, malaise, pain, well-being, desire—offer organisms a new layer of life regulation because of their inherent conscious status. Consciousness spontaneously delivers valuable knowledge into the decision-making mental space. Consciousness allows organisms to act deliberately and knowingly, rather than acting or failing to act, automatically and blindly. Consciousness is what makes deliberate life regulation possible. The intrinsic conscious nature of feelings is their grace and was their passport into natural selection. Their conscious nature is not a neutral trait.” Damasio assumes that “the emergence of consciousness occurred when homeostatic feelings first arose, there and then, and naturally provided knowledge concerning life” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib178" name="bbib178" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib178"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Damasio, 2019</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib179" name="bbib179" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib179"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2021a</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib178" name="bbib178" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib178"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Damasio, 2019</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.5.4"><h4 id="sectitle0310" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.5.4. Friston's free-energy principle and active inference</h4><p id="p1890">Theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston conceptualizes consciousness as the natural outcome of his “free-energy principle for action and perception (active inference),” which stresses the primacy of minimizing in all organisms the difference between perceptual expectations (required for homeostasis) and real-time sensory inputs (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib274" name="bbib274" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib274"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston et al, 2017</span></span></a>). In this mechanism, human brains seek to minimize the difference—reduce the “surprise,” as it were—by generating internal models that predict the external world.</p><p id="p1895">As a physicist and psychiatrist, Friston says: “I find it difficult to engage with conversations about consciousness. My biggest gripe is that the philosophers and cognitive scientists who tend to pose the questions often assume that the mind is a thing, whose existence can be identified by the attributes it has or the purposes it fulfills.” The deeper question, he asks, is “what sorts of processes give rise to the notion (or illusion) that something exists?” Thus, Friston treats consciousness “as a process to be understood, not as a thing to be defined.” Simply put, his argument is that “consciousness is nothing more and nothing less than a natural process such as evolution or the weather” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib273" name="bbib273" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib273"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1900">Friston's perspective on process leads him to “an elegant, if rather deflationary, story about why the mind exists.” It focuses on “inference,” which Friston characterizes as “actually quite close to a theory of everything—including evolution, consciousness, and life itself.” We are processes and processes can only reason towards what is “out there” based on “sparse samples of the world; ” hence, the criticality of inference. This view, Friston says, “dissolves familiar dialectics between mind and matter, self and world, and representationalism (we depict reality as it is) and emergentism (reality comes into being through our abductive encounters with the world)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib273" name="bbib273" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib273"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1905">But how did inert matter ever begin the processes that led to consciousness? It starts with complex systems that are self-organizing because they possess “attractors,” which are “cycles of mutually reinforcing states that allow processes to achieve a point of stability, not by losing energy until they stop, but through what's known as dynamic equilibrium. An intuitive example is homeostasis ….” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib273" name="bbib273" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib273"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1910">It's at this point that Friston focuses on inference, “the process of figuring out the best principle or hypothesis that explains the observed states of that system we call ‘the world.’” Every time you have a new experience, he says, “you engage in some kind of inference to try to fit what's happening into a familiar pattern, or to revise your internal states so as to take account of this new fact.”</p><p id="p1915">That's why attractors are so crucial, he stresses, “because an attracting state has a low surprise and high evidence.” A failure to minimize surprise means “the system will decay into surprising, unfamiliar states” – which would threaten its existence. “Attractors are the product of processes engaging in inference to summon themselves into being,” he says. “In other words, attractors are the foundation of what it means to be alive” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib273" name="bbib273" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib273"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1920">Friston applies the same thinking to consciousness and suggests that consciousness must also be a process of inference. “Conscious processing is about inferring the causes of sensory states, and thereby navigating the world to elude surprises … This sort of internalization of the causal structure of the world ‘out there’ reflects the fact that to predict one's own states you must have an internal model of how such sensations are generated” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib273" name="bbib273" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib273"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1925">Learning as well as inference, Friston continues, relies on minimizing the brain's free energy. “Cortical responses can be seen as the brain's attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib272" name="bbib272" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib272"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2005</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1930">In short, consciousness is the evolved mechanism for simulating scenarios of the world. It is the internal emergent model that monitors and minimizes the free energy principle, the difference between internal perceptual expectations and real-time sensory input that reflects the external world. Friston proposes that “the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a temporal thickness or counterfactual depth, which grounds the inferences it can make about the consequences of future actions.” Consciousness, he contends, “is nothing grander than inference about my future” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib273" name="bbib273" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib273"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Friston, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1935">Friston's consciousness as active inference leads to its metaphysical stamp as “Markovian monism,” which, he says, rests upon the information geometry induced in any system whose internal states can be distinguished from external states—such that “the (intrinsic) information geometry of the probabilistic evolution of internal states and a separate (extrinsic) information geometry of probabilistic beliefs about external states that are parameterized by internal states.” Friston calls these information geometries intrinsic (i.e., mechanical, or state-based) and extrinsic (i.e., Markovian, or belief-based).

Solms's affect as the hidden spring of consciousness</h4><p id="p1945">Neuroscientist and psychoanalyst Mark Solms applies Friston's free energy principle to the hard problem of consciousness. He identifies the elemental form of consciousness as affect and locates its physiological mechanism (an extended form of homeostasis) in the upper brainstem. Free energy minimization (in unpredicted contexts) is operationalized “where decreases and increases in expected uncertainty are felt as pleasure and unpleasure, respectively.” He offers reasons “why such existential imperatives feel like something to and for an organism” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib720" name="bbib720" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib720"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1950">A physicalist, Solms argues that the brain does not “produce” or “cause” consciousness. “Formulating the relationship between the brain and the mind in causal terms,” he says, “makes the hard problem harder than it needs to be. The brain does not produce consciousness in the sense that the liver produces bile, and physiological processes do not cause—or become or turn into—mental experiences through some curious metaphysical transformation” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib720" name="bbib720" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib720"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1955">Objectivity and subjectivity are observational perspectives, he says, not causes and effects. “Neurophysiological events can no more produce psychological events than lightning can produce thunder. They are dual manifestations of a single underlying process. The cause of both lightning and thunder is electrical discharge, the lawful action of which explains them both. Physiological and psychological phenomena must likewise be reduced to unitary causes, not to one another. This is merely a restatement of a well-known position on the mind–body problem: that of dual-aspect monism”<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn26" name="bfn26" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn26"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>26</sup></span></span></a> (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib722" name="bbib722" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib722"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2021b</span></span></a>).

His reasoning applies the free energy principle (9.5.4) in neurobiology such that feelings would uniquely enable humans to monitor interactions with unpredictable environments and modify their behaviors accordingly.</p><p id="p1965">Solms explains that “complex organisms have multiple needs, each of which must be met in its own right, and, indeed, on a context-dependent basis, they cannot be reduced to a common denominator. For example … fear trumps sleepiness in some contexts but not in others.” So, he says, the needs of complex organisms like ourselves must be coded as categorical variables, which are distinguished qualitatively, not quantitatively. Thirst feels different from sleepiness feels different from separation distress feels different from fear, etc., such that their combined optimized resolution must be computed in a context-dependent fashion, which would lead to “excessively complex calculations,” a “combinatorial explosion.” In terms of time spent and energy expended, the invention of affect, emotion, feeling is a much more efficient algorithm. Moreover, Solms adds, since “the needs of complex organisms which can act differentially, in flexible ways, in variable contexts, are ‘color-coded’ or ‘flavored,’ this provides at least one mechanistic imperative for qualia” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib721" name="bbib721" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib721"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2021a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib722" name="bbib722" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib722"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2021b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1970">Solms seeks to demystify consciousness by showing that “cortical functioning is accompanied by consciousness if and only if it is ‘enabled’ by the reticular activating system of the upper brainstem. Damage to just two cubic millimeters of this primitive tissue reliably obliterates consciousness as a whole.” He rejects arguments that the reticular activating system generates only the quantitative “level” of consciousness (consciousness in a waking/comatose sense) and not its qualitative “contents” (consciousness as experience). This is affect, Solms says, and it is supported by “overwhelming” evidence. Therefore, since cortical consciousness is contingent upon brainstem consciousness, and since brainstem consciousness is affective, Solms concludes that “<em>affect is the foundational form of consciousness</em>. Sentient subjectivity (in its elementary form) is literally constituted by affect” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib721" name="bbib721" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib721"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2021a</span></span></a>).<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn27" name="bfn27" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn27"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>27</sup></span></span></a></p><p id="p1975">Solms distinguishes between information processing models in cognitive science, which seem to lack question-askers, and self-organizing systems, which are obliged to ask questions—“their very survival depends upon it. They must chronically ask: ‘What will happen to my free energy if I do that?’ The answers they receive determine their confidence in the current prediction.” This is why Solms states “not all information processing (‘integrated’ or otherwise) is conscious; sentience appears to be a property of only some information processing systems with very specific properties, namely those systems that must ask questions of their surrounding world in relation to their existential needs” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib721" name="bbib721" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib721"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2021a</span></span></a>)</p><p id="p1980">In summary, Solms claims that the functional mechanism of consciousness can be reduced to physical laws, such as Friston's free-energy law, among others. These laws, he says, “are no less capable of explaining how and why proactively resisting entropy (i.e., avoiding oblivion) feels like something to the organism, for the organism, than other scientific laws are capable of explaining other natural things. Consciousness is part of nature, and is mathematically tractable.”</p><p id="p1985">As a corollary, with respect to Crick's research program on the neural correlates of consciousness, Solms declares that there can be no objects of consciousness (e.g. visual ones) in the absence of a subject of consciousness. To Solms, the subject of consciousness is literally constituted by affect (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib721" name="bbib721" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib721"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Solms, 2021a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p1990">Regarding AI consciousness, Solms posits that if his theory is correct, “then, in principle, an artificially conscious self-organizing system can be engineered.” The creation of an artificial consciousness would be, he says, “the ultimate test of any claim to have solved the hard problem.” But, he warns, “we must proceed with extreme caution.”</p></section><section id="sec9.5.6"><h4 id="sectitle0320" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.5.6. Carhart-Harris's entropic brain hypothesis</h4><p id="p1995">Psychopharmacologist Robin Carhart-Harris proposes the Entropic Brain Hypothesis in which the entropy of spontaneous brain activity indexes the informational richness of conscious states (within upper and lower limits, after which consciousness may be lost). A leading psychedelic researcher, Carhart-Harris reports that the entropy of brain activity is elevated in the psychedelic state, and there is evidence for greater brain “criticality” under psychedelics. (“Criticality … is the property of being poised at a ‘critical’ point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear.”) He argues that “heightened brain criticality enables the brain to be more sensitive to intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations which may translate as a heightened susceptibility to ‘set’ and ‘setting.’” Measures of brain entropy, he suggests, can inform the treatment of psychiatric and neurological conditions such as depression and disorders of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib107" name="bbib107" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib107"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carhart-Harris, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2000">The “entropy” in the Entropic Brain Hypothesis is defined as “a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder.” Entropy is then applied in “the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state … [which] is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness.” Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, Carhart-Harris argues that “the defining feature of ‘primary states’ is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit ‘criticality’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib107" name="bbib107" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib107"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carhart-Harris, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2005">Significantly, “if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality.” This leads to the idea that “entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness.” Carhart-Harris and colleagues also propose that “entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network” (DMN—a set of regions more active during passive tasks than tasks requiring focused external attention, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib92" name="bbib92" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib92"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Buckner, 2013</span></span></a>),<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn28" name="bfn28" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn28"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>28</sup></span></span></a> thus maintaining the brain's homeostasis and “a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib109" name="bbib109" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib109"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carhart-Harris et al., 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2010">Increased entropy in spontaneous neural activity is one of the most notable neurophysiological signatures of psychedelics and is said to be relevant to the psychedelic experience, mediating both acute alterations in consciousness and long-term effects.

Buzsáki's neural syntax and self-caused rhythms</h4><p id="p2020">Neuroscientist György Buzsáki presents the brain as “a foretelling device that interacts with its environment through action and the examination of action's consequence,” restructuring its internal rhythms in the process. In his telling, “our brains are initially filled with nonsense patterns, all of which are gibberish until grounded by action-based interactions. By matching these nonsense ‘words’ to the outcomes of action, they acquire meaning.” Once brain circuits are “calibrated” or trained by action and experience, “the brain can disengage from its sensors and actuators, and examine ‘what happens if’ scenarios by peeking into its own computation, a process that we refer to as cognition.” Buzsáki stresses that “our brain is not an information-absorbing coding device, as it is often portrayed, but a venture-seeking explorer constantly controlling the body to test hypotheses.” Our brain does not process information. He says, our brain “creates it” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib99" name="bbib99" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib99"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Buzsáki, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2025">Buzsáki focuses on "neural syntax", which segments neural information and organizes it via diverse brain rhythms to generate and support cognitive functions. One expression is the “hierarchical organization of brain rhythms of different frequencies and their cross-frequency coupling.” Buzsáki shows that “in the absence of changing environmental signals, cortical circuits continuously generate self-organized cell assembly sequences”—clusters of neurons acting as focused functional units—that are the neuronal assembly basis of cognitive functions. He also shows “how skewed distribution of firing rates supports robustness, sensitivity, plasticity, and stability in neuronal networks” (Buzsáki, <em>Wikipedia</em>).</p><p id="p2030">Buzsáki's foundational idea is that “spontaneous neuron activity, far from being mere noise, is actually the source of our cognitive abilities,” and that “self-emerged oscillatory timing is the brain's fundamental organizer of neuronal information." The perpetual interactions among these multiple network oscillators, he says, “keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive ‘metastable’ state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib98" name="bbib98" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib98"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Buzsáki, 2011</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2035">Taken together, Buzsáki coins his “inside-out” view. “The brain,” he says, “is a self-organized system with preexisting connectivity and dynamics whose main job is to generate actions and to examine and predict the consequences of those actions”. Brains draw from and interact with the world, rather than detect it. “In other words, rather than the world filling in the brain with information, the brain fills out the world with action.” Flipping the brain–world relationship, Buzsáki posits that brain activity is fundamentally self-caused (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib308" name="bbib308" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib308"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomez-Marin, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2040">Brain rhythms are Buzsáki's key mechanisms. “Spanning several orders of magnitude, and organized in nested frequency bands, these fascinating neuronal oscillations support neuronal syntax.” As Buzsáki puts it, “activity travels in neuronal space, much like waves in a pond.” Cognition is merely internalized action, and it arises when the brain disengages from the world. He thus recasts “the cognitive into the neural by means of action as a kind of ultimate cognitive source. It is action all the way in, all the way out, and all the way down” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib308" name="bbib308" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib308"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomez-Marin, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2045">Still, Buzsáki must explain how endogenously produced neural syntax acquires its meaning, and to do so, he reaches outside the brain. Semantics are selected by the world, he stresses, and here's how it works. External inputs, sequences of perceptions that constitute wholes or fragments of meaning, engage and modify self-organized neural patterns so that they become meaningful and useful (broadly). Similarly, Buzsáki has learning as a matching process. “Existing, spontaneous neural patterns are selected rather than constructed anew. The brain is not a blank slate but one filled with syntactically correct gibberish that progressively acquires meaning via the pruning of the arbitrariness that the world affords” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib308" name="bbib308" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib308"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomez-Marin, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2050">Related, Buzsáki and Tingley explain cognition, including memory, “by exaptation and expansion of the circuits and algorithms serving bodily functions.” They explain how “Regulation and protection of metabolic and energetic processes require time-evolving brain computations enabling the organism to prepare for altered future states.” The exaptation of such circuits, according to the authors, was likely exploited for exploration of the organism's niche, giving rise to “a cognitive map,” which in turn “allows for mental travel into the past (memory) and the future (planning)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib101" name="bbib101" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib101"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Buzsáki and Tingley, 2023</span></span></a>).

Leading scientific theories of consciousness do not reference it, assign it only a marginal role, or treat it as an information-theoretical quantity. If it is discussed, it is either as a substrate underpinning higher level emergent dynamics or as powering neural information processing.” He argues that “the governing principle of the brain at the neural level is not information processing but energy processing,” although the information-theoretic approach can complement the energetic approach. Pepperell puts “information in the biological context as best understood as a measure of the way energetic activity is organized, that is, its complexity or degree of differentiation and integration.” While “information theoretic techniques provide powerful tools for measuring, modeling, and mapping the organization of energetic processes,” he says, “we should not confuse the map with the territory” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib606" name="bbib606" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib606"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Pepperell, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2135">In comparison with mainstream brain organization frameworks at the global level or localized, Pepperell offers, as an alternative or complementary way of thinking, how the energetic activity in the brain is organized. The challenge for the model is why energetic processing is associated with consciousness in the brain but not in other organs, like the liver or heart. Pepperell claims that energetic activity in the brain efficiently actuates <em>differences</em> of motion and tension that make the difference, perhaps via dynamic recursive organization – the “appropriate reentrant intracortical activity.”</p><p id="p2140">“If we are to naturalize consciousness,” Pepperell concludes, "then we must reconcile energy and the mind.” Treating the brain as a difference engine that serves “the interests of the organism is a natural approach to understanding consciousness as a physical process” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib606" name="bbib606" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib606"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Pepperell, 2018</span></span></a>).</p></section></section><section id="sec9.6"><h3 id="sectitle0355" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.6.

The enactive view is that cognition develops via dynamic, bidirectional exchanges between an organism and its surroundings. It is not the case that an organism seeks optimum homeostasis in a static environment, but rather that the organism is shaping its environment, and is being shaped by its environment—actively, iteratively, continuously—all mediated by that organism's sensorimotor processes. Thus, organisms are active agents in the world who affect the world and who are affected by the world.

He starts with one of Chalmers's basic points: first-hand experience is an irreducible field of phenomena. He claims there is no “theoretical fix” or “extra ingredient” in nature that can possibly bridge this gap. Instead, the field of conscious phenomena require a rigorous method and an explicit pragmatics. It is a quest, he says, to marry modern cognitive science and a disciplined approach to human experience, thereby placing himself in the lineage of the continental tradition of phenomenology (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib815" name="bbib815" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib815"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Varela, 1996</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2185">Varela calls for gathering a research community armed with new tools to develop a science of consciousness. He claims that no piecemeal empirical correlates, nor purely theoretical principles, will do the job. He advocates turning to a systematic exploration of the only link between mind and consciousness that seems both obvious and natural: the structure of human experience itself.</p><p id="p2190">Varela's phenomenological approach starts with the irreducible nature of conscious experience. Lived experience, he says, is “where we start from and where all must link back to, like a guiding thread.” From a phenomenological standpoint, “conscious experience is quite at variance with that of mental content as it figures in the Anglo-American philosophy of mind.” He advocates examining, “beyond the spook of subjectivity, the concrete possibilities of a disciplined examination of experience that is at the very core of the phenomenological inspiration.” He repeats: “it is the re-discovery of the primacy of human experience and its direct, lived quality that is phenomenology's foundational project” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib815" name="bbib815" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib815"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Varela, 1996</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2195">Varela's key point is that by emphasizing a co-determination of both accounts—phenomenological and neurobiological—one can explore the bridges, challenges, insights and contradictions between them. This means that both domains have equal status in demanding full attention and respect for their specificity. It is quite easy, he says, to see how scientific accounts illuminate mental experience, but the reciprocal direction, from experience towards science, is what is typically ignored.</p><p id="p2200">What do phenomenological accounts provide? Varela asks. “At least two main aspects of the larger picture. First, without them the firsthand quality of experience vanishes, or it becomes a mysterious riddle. Second, structural accounts provide constraints on empirical observations.” He stresses that “the study of experience is not a convenient stop on our way to a real explanation, but an active participant in its own right.” And while phenomenal experience is at an irreducible ontological level, “it retains its quality of immediacy because it plays a role in structural coherence via its intuitive contents, and thus keeps alive its direct connection to human experience, rather than pushing it into abstraction” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib815" name="bbib815" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib815"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Varela, 1996</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2205">This makes the whole difference, Varela argues: The “hardness” and riddle become an open-ended research program with the structure of human experience playing a central role in the scientific endeavor. “In all functionalistic accounts what is missing is not the coherent nature of the explanation but its alienation from human life. Only by putting human life back in, will that absence be erased” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib815" name="bbib815" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib815"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Varela, 1996</span></span></a>).

The continuing hope is that neurophenomenology can inform the science of consciousness, that the ongoing interaction between human experience and neuroscience becomes “an act of art, a deep listening, an improvisational dance, which slowly develops into a skillful scientific dialogue” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib45" name="bbib45" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib45"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2020</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.6.4"><h4 id="sectitle0375" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.6.4. Thompson's mind in life</h4><p id="p2215">Philosopher Evan Thompson heralds “the deep continuity of life and mind.” His foundational idea is “Where there is life there is mind, and mind in its most articulated forms belongs to life,” and his organizing principle is “Life and mind share a core set of formal or organizational properties, and the formal or organizational properties distinctive of mind are an enriched version of those fundamental to life.” More precisely, he says, “the self-organizing features of mind are an enriched version of the self-organizing features of life. The self-producing or ‘autopoietic’ organization of biological life already implies cognition, and this incipient mind finds sentient expression in the self-organizing dynamics of action, perception, and emotion, as well as in the self-moving flow of time-consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib791" name="bbib791" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib791"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Thompson, 2002</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib520" name="bbib520" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib520"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Maturana and Varela, 1980</span></span></a>).<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn29" name="bfn29" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn29"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>29</sup></span></span></a></p><p id="p2220">From this perspective, Thompson sees mental life as bodily life and as situated in the world. The roots of mental life lie not simply in the brain, he says, “but ramify through the body and environment. Our mental lives involve our body and the world beyond the surface membrane of our organism, and therefore cannot be reduced simply to brain processes inside the head.”</p><p id="p2225">With this framework, Thompson seeks to reduce (if not bridge) the so-called “explanatory gap” between consciousness and world, mind and brain, first-person subjectivity and third-person objectivity (i.e., the hard problem of consciousness). He works to achieve this (to oversimplify) by having the same kinds of processes that enable the transition from nonlife to life to enable the transition from life to mind. (I'd think he would rather eliminate the concept of “transition” altogether and consider life-mind as a unified concept—perhaps like, in cosmology, the once apparent independent dimensions of space and time now unified by a single physical concept, spacetime.)</p><p id="p2230">As a pioneer of enactivism (9.6.2), Thompson posits that “the enactive approach offers important resources for making progress on the explanatory gap” by explicating “selfhood and subjectivity from the ground up by accounting for the autonomy proper to living and cognitive beings.” He extends the idea with "embodied dynamism,” a key concept that combines dynamic systems and embodied approaches to cognition. While the former reflects enactivism, the latter is the enhancement (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib791" name="bbib791" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib791"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Thompson, 2002</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2235">According to Thompson, the central idea of the dynamic systems approach is that cognition is an intrinsically temporal phenomenon expressible in “the form of a set of evolution equations that describe how the state of the system changes over time. The collection of all possible states of the system corresponds to the system's ‘state space’ or ‘phase space,’ and the ways that the system changes state correspond to trajectories in this space.” Dynamic-system explanations, he says, consist of “the internal and external forces that shape such trajectories as they unfold in time. Inputs are described as perturbations to the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than as instructions to be followed, and internal states are described as self-organized compensations triggered by perturbations, rather than as representations of external states of affairs” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib791" name="bbib791" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib791"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Thompson, 2002</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2240">To make real progress on the explanatory gap, Thompson says, “we need richer phenomenological accounts of the structure of experience, and we need scientific accounts of mind and life informed by these phenomenological accounts.” My aim, he says, “is not to close the explanatory gap in a reductive sense, but rather to enlarge and enrich the philosophical and scientific resources we have for addressing the gap.”</p><p id="p2245">Calling on the philosophical tradition of phenomenology, inaugurated by Edmund Husserl and developed by others, primarily Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Thompson seeks to “naturalize” phenomenology by aligning its investigations with advances in biology and cognitive science and to complement science and its objectification of the world by reawakening basic experiences of the world via phenomenology. His main move is for cognitive science “to learn from the analyses of lived experience accomplished by phenomenologists …. which thus needs to be recognized and cultivated as an indispensable partner to the experimental sciences of mind and life” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib791" name="bbib791" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib791"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Thompson, 2002</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2250">The deeper convergence of the enactive approach and phenomenology, Thompson says, is that “both share a view of the mind as having to constitute its objects.” He stresses that “constitute” does not mean fabricate or create, but rather “to bring to awareness, to present, or to disclose.” Thus, “the mind brings things to awareness; it discloses and presents the world. Stated in a classical phenomenological way, the idea is that objects are disclosed or made available to experience in the ways they are thanks to the intentional activities of consciousness.” Thompson argues that weaving together the phenomenological and neurobiological can “bridge the gap between subjective experience and biology, which defines the aim of neurophenomenology (9.6.4), an offshoot of the enactive approach” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib791" name="bbib791" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib791"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Thompson, 2002</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.6.5"><h4 id="sectitle0380" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.6.5.

Bitbol's radical neurophenomenology</h4><p id="p2285">Philosopher of science and phenomenologist Michel Bitbol promotes a “radical neurophenomenology” in which a “tangled dialectic of body and consciousness” is the “metaphysical counterpart” and whose goal is to advance Varela's neurophenomenology project (9.6.3) of criticizing and dissolving the “hard problem” of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib55" name="bbib55" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib55"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2021a</span></span></a>). Bitbol claims that the neurophenomenological approach to the “hard problem” is underrated and often misunderstood; indeed, “in its original version, neurophenomenology implies nothing less than a change in our own being to dispel the mere sense that there is a problem to be theoretically solved or dissolved. Neurophenomenology thus turns out to be much more radical than the enactivist kinds of dissolution” (9.6.2) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib58" name="bbib58" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib58"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol and Antonova, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2290">Did Varela himself have a theory to solve the hard problem? No, Varela declared (in Bitbol's report) “only a ‘remedy”—the point being that “there exists a stance (let's call it the Varelian stance) in which the problem of the physical origin of primary consciousness, or pure experience, does not even arise.” The implications, according to Bitbol, are that “the nature of the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness is changed from an intellectual puzzle to an existential option.” The “constructivist content,” he says, is that “The role of ontological prejudice about what the world is made of (a prejudice that determines the very form of the ‘hard problem’ as the issue of the origin of consciousness out of a pre-existing material organization) is downplayed” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib52" name="bbib52" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib52"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2012</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2295">Bitbol blames “the standard (physicalist) formulation of this problem” for both generating it and turning it into “a fake mystery.” But he recognizes that dissolving the hard problem is very demanding for researchers, because “it invites them to leave their position of neutral observers/thinkers, and to seek self-transformation instead.” Bitbol's approach “leaves no room for the ‘hard problem’ in the field of discourse, and rather deflects it onto the plane of attitudes.” This runs the risk, he says, of “being either ignored or considered as a dodge” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib55" name="bbib55" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib55"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2021a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2300">Bitbol's method is “a metaphysical compensation for the anti-metaphysical premise of the neurophenomenological dissolution of the ‘hard problem.’” This can be achieved, he says, by designing this alternative metaphysics “to keep the benefit of a shift from discourse to ways of being, which is “the latent message of neurophenomenology” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib55" name="bbib55" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib55"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2021a</span></span></a>). In its most radical version, “neurophenomenology asks researchers to suspend the quest of an objective solution to the problem of the origin of subjectivity, and clarify instead how objectification can be obtained out of the coordination of subjective experiences. It therefore invites researchers to develop their inquiry about subjective experience with the same determination as their objective inquiry.” Bitbol proposes a methodology to explore lived experience faithfully (via microphenomenological interviews retrieving or “evoking past experiences”) and thereby “addresses a set of traditional objections against introspection” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib59" name="bbib59" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib59"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol and Petitmengin, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2305">Bitbol gives neuroscience no privilege, priority or pride of place. “The effective primacy of lived experience should be given such prominence that every other aspect, content, achievement, distortion, and physicalist account of consciousness, is made conditional upon it.” From a (radical) phenomenological standpoint, he says, “one must not mistake objectivity for reality. Reality is what is given and manifest, whereas objectivity is what is constituted by extracting structural invariants from the given experience. Along with this phenomenological approach, an objective science is not supposed to disclose reality as it is beyond appearances, but only to circumscribe some intersubjectively recognized features of the appearing reality.” Having said that, Bitbol stresses that “neuroscientific data should not be granted a higher ontological status than phenomenological descriptions; they should not be given the power to render a compelling verdict about what is real and what is deceptive in our experience.” Thus, he sums up: “from a phenomenological standpoint, the neuro-phenomenological correlation is plainly perceived as an extension of the lived sense of embodiment, not as a sign that some naturalistic one-directional ‘fundamental dependence’ of consciousness on the bodily brain is taking place” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib53" name="bbib53" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib53"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2310">Bitbol's affirmative solution is to formulate a “dynamical and participatory conception of the relation between body and consciousness … with no concession to standard positions such as physicalist monism and property dualism.” Bitbol's conception is based on Varela's formalism of “cybernetic dialectic,” “a geometrical model of self-production,” and it is “in close agreement with Merleau-Ponty's ‘intra-ontology’: an engaged ontological approach of what it is like to be, rather than a discipline of the contemplation of beings” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib55" name="bbib55" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib55"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2021a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2315">Bitbol's approach to quantum physics complements his “radical phenomenology,” such that quantum mechanics becomes more a "symbolism of atomic measurements,” rather than “a description of atomic objects.” He supports the notion that “quantum laws do not express the nature of physical objects, but only the bounds of experimental information.” Similarly, Bitbol supports QBism, where the wave function's probabilities are said to be, shockingly (to me), <em>Bayesian</em> probabilities, which means they relate to prior subjective degrees of belief about the system, paralleling some ideas in phenomenology (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib57" name="bbib57" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib57"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2320">Bitbol calls out “three features of such non-interpretational, non-committal approaches to quantum physics” that “strongly evoke the phenomenological epistemology.” These are: “their deliberately first-person stance; their suspension of judgment about a presumably external domain of objects, and subsequent redirection of attention towards the activity of constituting these objects; their perception-like conception of quantum knowledge.” Moreover, Bitbol claims that these new approaches of quantum physics go beyond phenomenological epistemology and “also make implicit use of a phenomenological ontology.” He cites Chris Fuch's “participatory realism” that “formulates a non-external variety of realism for one who is deeply immersed in reality,” adding, “but participatory realism strongly resembles Merleau-Ponty's endo-ontology, which is a phenomenological ontology for one who deeply participates in Being” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib54" name="bbib54" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib54"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2020</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib283" name="bbib283" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib283"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gefter, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2325">QBist theorists assert that “quantum states are ‘expectations about experiences of pointer readings,’” rather than expectations about pointer positions.

Philosopher Ned Block describes non-mainstream views of phenomenal consciousness that take it to work via this kind of “a direct awareness relation to a peculiar entity like a sense datum [i.e., that which is immediately available to the senses] or to objects or properties in the environment.” This direct awareness would seem to have to be “a primitive unanalyzable acquaintance relation that is not a matter of representation.” According to these direct realist or naïve realist theories of consciousness, “the phenomenal character of a perceptual experience is object-constituted in the sense that a perceptual experience of a tomato depends for its existence and individuation on the tomato. Any experience that is of a different tomato will have a different phenomenal character, even if it is phenomenally indistinguishable and even if the different tomato is exactly the same in all its properties and causes exactly the same activations in the brain.” Even subjectively indistinguishable hallucinatory experience would have to be different in phenomenal character as well (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib72" name="bbib72" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib72"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Block, 2023</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.6.8"><h4 id="sectitle0395" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.6.8.

Hylomorphism is the claim that structure is a basic ontological and explanatory principle, and is responsible for individuals being the kinds of things they are, and having the powers or capacities they have. As Jaworski explains, “A human is not a random collection of physical materials, but an individual composed of physical materials with a structure that accounts for what it is and what it can do—the powers it has. What is true of humans is true of their activities as well.” Structured activities, he says, include perceptual experiences, which means that everything about a perceptual experience, including its phenomenal character, can be explained by describing the perceiver's structure: perceptual subsystems, the powers of those subsystems, and the coordination that unifies their activities into the activity of the perceiver as a whole. Conscious experiences, Jaworski concludes, “thus fit unproblematically into the natural world—just as unproblematically as the phenomenon of life” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib412" name="bbib412" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib412"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaworski, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2475">According to Jaworski, from a hylomorphic perspective, “mind-body problems are byproducts of a worldview that rejects structure, and which lacks a basic principle which distinguishes the parts of the physical universe that can think, feel, and perceive from those that can't. Without such a principle, the existence of those powers in the physical world can start to look inexplicable and mysterious.” But if mental phenomena are structural phenomena, he says, then they are part of the physical world and thus “hylomorphism provides an elegant way of solving mind-body problems” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib411" name="bbib411" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib411"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaworski, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2480">While hylomorphism exemplifies a suite of arguments purporting to undermine the hard problem, its own challenge seems two-fold: (i) by defining structure as primitive and fundamental, it almost embeds the desired conclusion in the definitional premise; and (ii) by not distinguishing kinds of structure, all structure holds the same level of ultimate explanation, which may not fit consciousness.</p></section><section id="sec9.7.7"><h4 id="sectitle0435" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.7.7.

Process panexperientialists assume that it lies in the very nature of things for events of experiential creativity to occur—for partially self-creative experiences to arise out of prior experiences and then to help create subsequent experiences.

The visual system provides a case where “forward connections from primary visual area V1, the first cortical visual area, carry information to higher-level processing areas, and the initial registration of visual information involves a forward sweep of processing.” Moreover, many feedback connections link visual areas with other brain regions, which, later in processing, are activated and thereby yield dynamic activity within the visual system (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib840" name="bbib840" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib840"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wu, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2590">Lamme proposes four stages of visual processing: Stage 1: Visual signals are processed locally within the visual system (i.e., superficial feedforward processing).

These activations are only sufficient given background conditions. Those background conditions probably include intact connectivity with subcortical structures.” What then is “enough for conscious perceptual phenomenology” is “the active recurrent loops in perceptual areas plus background conditions.” Block concludes: “So long as high-level representations participate in those recurrent loops, conscious high-level content is assured” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib72" name="bbib72" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib72"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Block, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 8–9).</p><p id="p2605">Lamme critiques Global Workspace Theory [9.2.3] as “all about access but not about seeing” (even though his Stage 4 is consistent with global workspace access).

This means that phenomenal consciousness is not immediate awareness of sensations. Rather, it is the higher-level sensing of those sensations, a product of second-order thoughts about first-order perceptions or mental states—a two-level process. Higher-Order Theories are distinguished from other cognitive accounts of phenomenal consciousness which assume that first-order perceptions or mental states can themselves be directly conscious—a one-level process (9.8.1, 9.8.2) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib120" name="bbib120" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib120"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carruthers, 2020</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib368" name="bbib368" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib368"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Higher-order theories of consciousness, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2620">According to Peter Carruthers, “humans not only have first-order non-conceptual and/or analog perceptions of states of their environments and bodies, they also have second-order non-conceptual and/or analog perceptions of their first-order states of perception.” This higher-order perception theory holds that “humans (and perhaps other animals) not only have sense-organs that scan the environment/body to produce fine-grained representations, but they also have inner senses which scan the first-order senses (i.e. perceptual experiences) to produce equally fine-grained, but higher-order, representations of those outputs.” Hence, Higher-Order Theories are also called “inner-sense theory.” Notably, “the higher-order approach does not attempt to reduce consciousness directly to neurophysiology but rather its reduction is in mentalistic terms, that is, by using such notions as thoughts and awareness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib106" name="bbib106" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib106"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Cardenas-Garcia, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2625">The main motivation driving higher-order theories of consciousness, according to Carruthers, “derives from the belief that all (or at least most) mental-state types admit of both conscious and unconscious varieties … And then if we ask what makes the difference between a conscious and an unconscious mental state, one natural answer is that conscious states are states that we are aware of.” This translates into the view that conscious states are states “that are the objects of some sort of higher-order representation—whether a higher-order perception or experience, or a higher-order thought” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib106" name="bbib106" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib106"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Cardenas-Garcia, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2630">Various flavors of higher-order theories can be distinguished, including the following (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib106" name="bbib106" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib106"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Cardenas-Garcia, 2023</span></span></a>):<ul class="list"><li class="react-xocs-list-item"><span><p id="p2635">Actualist Higher-Order Thought Theory (championed by David Rosenthal): A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state that is the object of a higher-order thought, and which causes that thought non-inferentially.<br></p></span></li><li class="react-xocs-list-item"><span><p id="p2640">Dispositionalist Higher-Order Thought Theory: A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state that is available to cause (non-inferentially) higher-order thoughts about itself (or perhaps about any of the contents of a special-purpose, short-term memory store).<br></p></span></li><li class="react-xocs-list-item"><span><p id="p2645">Self-Representational Theory: A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state that, at the same time, possesses an intentional content, thereby in some sense representing <em>itself</em> to the person who is the subject of that state.</p></span></li></ul></p><p id="p2650">According to Ned Block, there are two approaches to higher-order thought (HOT) theories of consciousness. The “double representation” approach says that the HOT involves a distinct coding of the perceptual content, such that a conscious perception will be “accompanied” by a thought of that experience, giving two representations of the conscious experience, one perceptual, one cognitive and conceptual. He considers it “mysterious” how a perception can be conscious. The second version of HOT has a thought or at least a cognitive state that makes a perception conscious but that thought does not itself have any perceptual content. Block refers to Hakwan Lau, who sometimes describes the higher-order state as a “pointer” to a first-order state. The pointer theory is cognitive in that the pointer is a thought, but it is not conceptualist since it involves no concept of a conscious experience involved in the thought that is supposed to make a perception conscious (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib72" name="bbib72" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib72"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Block, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 425–426).</p><p id="p2655">Lau himself argues that the key to characterizing consciousness lies in its connections to belief formation and epistemic justification on a subjective level (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib482" name="bbib482" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib482"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lau, 2019a</span></span></a>); he describes consciousness as “a battle between your beliefs and perceptions” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib483" name="bbib483" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib483"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lau, 2019b</span></span></a>).

Bottom line, Lau strikes the ambitious claim that his theory explains the subjective “what-it-is-like-ness” of first-person experience—why it “<em>feels like something</em>” to be in a particular brain state, say with a sharp pain—mediated by higher-order representations in the brain (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib484" name="bbib484" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib484"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lau, 2022</span></span></a>, p. 197).</p><p id="p2705">Enhancing his model, Lau proposes that “because of the way the mammalian sensory cortices are organized, perceptual signals in the brain are spatially ‘analog’ in a specific sense,” which enables “computational advantages.” Given this analog nature, “when a sensory representation becomes conscious, not only do we have the tendency to think that its content reflects the state of the world right now, also determined is <em>what it is like</em> to have the relevant experience—in terms of how subjectively similar it is with respect to all other possible experiences.” Lau submits that this addresses the hard problem, “better than prominent alternative views” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib484" name="bbib484" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib484"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lau, 2022</span></span></a>, p. 29).</p></section><section id="sec9.8.5"><h4 id="sectitle0465" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.8.5. LeDoux's higher-order theory of emotional consciousness</h4><p id="p2710">Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux's Higher-Order Theory of Emotional Consciousness combines his approach to higher-order representationalism (9.8.3) and his commitment to the centrality of emotion. His thesis is that “the brain mechanisms that give rise to conscious emotional feelings are not fundamentally different from those that give rise to perceptual conscious experiences.” Both, he proposes, “involve higher-order representations (HORs) of lower-order information by cortically based general networks of cognition” (GNC). The theory argues that GNC and “self-centered higher-order states are essential for emotional experiences” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib492" name="bbib492" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib492"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ledoux and Brown, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2715">LeDoux challenges the traditional view that emotional states of consciousness (emotional feelings) are “innately programmed in subcortical areas of the brain,” and are “as different from cognitive states of consciousness, such as those related to the perception of external stimuli.” Rather, LeDoux argues that “conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain” and that “emotions are higher-order states instantiated in cortical circuits.” In this view, all that differs in emotional and nonemotional states are “the kinds of inputs that are processed.” According to LeDoux, “although subcortical circuits are not directly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences.”</p><p id="p2720">For understanding the emotional brain, LeDoux focuses on “fear,” defining it as “the conscious feeling one has when in danger.” In the presence of a threat, he says, “different circuits underlie the conscious feelings of fear and the behavioral responses and physiological responses that also occur.” But it is the “experience of fear,” the conscious emotional feeling of fear, that informs LeDoux's theory of consciousness, which he explains as follows. “A first-order representation of the threat enters into a higher-order representation, along with relevant long-term memories—including emotion schema—that are retrieved. This initial HOR involving the threat and the relevant memories occurs nonconsciously. Then, a HOROR [i.e., a third-order state, a HOR of a representation, a HOR of a HOR] allows for the conscious noetic experience of the stimulus as dangerous. However, to have the emotional autonoetic experience of fear, the self must be included in the HOROR” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib492" name="bbib492" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib492"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ledoux and Brown, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2725">Advancing his theory, LeDoux explores “introspection,” the term given by higher-order theorists to this third level of representations, that is, “to be aware of the higher-order state (to be conscious that you are in that state).” LeDoux proposes “a more inclusive view of introspection, in which the term indicates the process by which phenomenally experienced states result.” Introspection, he says, “can involve either passive noticing (as, for example, in the case of consciously seeing a ripe strawberry on the counter) or active scrutinizing (as in the case of deliberate focused attention to our conscious experience of the ripe strawberry).” Both kinds of introspection lead to phenomenal experience, in LeDoux's view (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib492" name="bbib492" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib492"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ledoux and Brown, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2730">HOROR theory states that “phenomenal consciousness does not reflect a sensory state (as proposed by first-order theory) or the relation between a sensory state and a higher-order cognitive state of working memory (as proposed by traditional HOT). Instead, HOROR posits that phenomenal consciousness consists of having the appropriate HOR of lower-order information, where lower-order does not necessarily mean sensory, but instead refers to a prior higher-order state that is rerepresented.” He says, “This second HOR is thought-like and, in virtue of this, instantiates the phenomenal, introspectively accessed experience of the external sensory stimulus. That is, to have a phenomenal experience is to be introspectively aware of a nonconscious HOR.” He distinguishes ordinary introspective awareness, which is the passive kind of “noticing” that he postulates is responsible for phenomenal consciousness, “from the active scrutinizing of one's conscious experience that requires deliberate attentive focus on one's phenomenal consciousness.” Active introspection, he stresses, “requires an additional layer of HOR (and thus a HOR of a HOROR).”</p><p id="p2735">In studies of human patients, LeDoux and his PhD adviser, Michael Gazzaniga, “concluded that conscious experiences are the result of cognitive interpretation situations in an effort to help maintain a sense of mental unity in the face of the neural diversity of non-conscious behavioral control systems in our brain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib491" name="bbib491" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib491"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">LeDoux, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2740">Rejecting the notion of the “self,” and certainly mind-body dualism, LeDoux positions “consciousness” as the fourth and final “realm of existence” for animal life, the four realms being “bodily, neural, cognitive, and conscious.” LeDoux replaces the self with an “ensemble of being” that “subsumes our entire human existence, both as individuals and as a species” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib490" name="bbib490" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib490"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">LeDoux, 2023a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2745">LeDoux's views continue to develop. In particular, he picks out two overarching perspectives. First, his <em>multi-state hierarchical model of consciousness</em>, which features an intricate anatomical framework evincing the complexity of higher-order processing via redundancy. The multi-state hierarchical model of consciousness, he says, “replaces the traditional volley between the sensory cortex and the lateral PFC [prefrontal cortex] with a more complex anatomical arrangement consisting of a hierarchy of structures, each of which creates different kinds of states that are re-represented/re-described by circuits of sub-granular and granular PFC and that contribute to higher-order mental modeling and conscious experience. The states that constitute the functional features of the multi-state hierarchical higher-order theory of consciousness, and the brain areas that are associated with these states, include primary lower-order states (areas of the sensory cortex); secondary lower-order states (memory areas and other convergence zones in the temporal and parietal lobes); sub-higher-order states (meso-cortical areas of sub-granular PFC, including the anterior cingulate, orbital, ventromedial, prelimbic, and insula PFC); and higher-order states that re-represent/re-describe/index the various other states to construct mental models in working memory (granular PFC)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib490" name="bbib490" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib490"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">LeDoux, 2023a</span></span></a>, p. 234).</p><p id="p2750">LeDoux's second overarching perspective is the <em>dual mental hypothesis</em> that shows the interplay between preconscious and conscious states and the role of narratives in driving them. In the dual mental-model hypothesis, he says, “explicit consciousness of complex events emerges from interactions between granular and sub-granular PFC states. Lower-order non-PFC states, while often involved as inputs to the PFC, are not necessary for such higher-order conscious experiences. In other words, a thought, which is a higher-order state constructed by a pre-conscious mental model, is sufficient to populate the conscious higher-order state via the second mental model.” The output of the conscious mental model, he says, “much like the output of the pre-conscious mental model, is an abstract mentalese narrative (albeit a conscious one) that feeds distributaries flowing to motor circuits that control overt behavior and verbal expression.” LeDoux senses that “this implies that we have conscious agency, which you may know of as free will”—adding, “the question of whether we actually make conscious choices is a matter of debate” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib490" name="bbib490" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib490"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">LeDoux, 2023a</span></span></a>, pp. 296–297).</p></section><section id="sec9.8.6"><h4 id="sectitle0470" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.8.6.

Their properties are to be explained, therefore, not literally as the properties of brain-states, but rather as the properties of mind-states dreamed up by the brain. Remarkably, we (and presumably other sentient creatures) represent what's happening as having “phenomenal properties”, or “qualia”, that fill the “thick time” of the subjective present. The result is we come to have a psychologically impressive sense of self—a “phenomenal self” that is semi-independent of our physical bodies. This idea of “what it’s like to be me” may be in some respects “fake news”; but Humphrey's point is that, to us as the subjects, it's big news!</p><p id="p2765">When it comes to how sensations are generated in the brain, Humphrey points out this has to be a two-stage process: first the gathering of sensory information, which is the sensory text, then the interpretation of this information, which is the conscious reading. This two-stage process generates our subjective take on what this is like for us. Phenomenal properties arise only at the interpretative stage. This, Humphrey stresses, is “a point often lost on researchers looking for the neural correlates of consciousness, who assume the properties of the brain activity must map onto the phenomenal properties of conscious experience.” He calls the hard problem “the wrong problem” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib386" name="bbib386" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib386"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Humphrey, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2770">Humphrey believes that our best approach to explaining sentience (which is how he labels phenomenal consciousness) will be “forward engineering”—reconstructing the steps by which natural selection could have invented it. He proposes that sensations originated in primitive animals as evaluative responses to stimulation at the body surface. Thus, sensations started out as something the animal did about the stimulation rather than something it felt about it. Early on, however, animals hit on the trick of monitoring these responses—by means of an “efference copy” of the command signals—to yield a simple representation of what the stimulation is about. In short, a feeling (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib387" name="bbib387" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib387"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Humphrey, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib388" name="bbib388" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib388"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Humphrey, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2775">Humphrey's story quickens, as that feeling became privatised, resulting in activity in neural feedback loops, which became recursive and stretched out in time, taking on complex higher-order properties. It was then refined and stabilised to generate mathematically complex attractor states, which would give rise—“out of the blue”—to the apparently unaccountable qualities of sensory qualia. Quite possibly, he says, phenomenal experience involves the brain generating something like an internal text, which it interprets as being about phenomenal properties. The driving force behind these later developments was the adaptive benefits to the animal of the emergence of the phenomenal self.</p><p id="p2780">This is why Humphrey takes phenomenal consciousness as a relatively late evolutionary invention, having evolved only in animal species that (a) have brains capable of entertaining and enjoying these fancy mental representations, and (b) lead lives in which having this bold sense of self can give them an edge in the fitness game.

But he defends materialism in general and functionalist theories of mind in particular by arguing for what he calls the "hegemony of representation," in that “there is no more to mind or consciousness than can be accounted for in terms of intentionality, functional organization, and in particular, second-order representation of one's own mental states” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib513" name="bbib513" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib513"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lycan, 1996</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2845">Reviewing “an explosion of work” in consciousness studies by philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists, Lycan is “struck by an astonishing diversity of topics that have gone under the heading of “consciousness”—he lists more than 15, only six of which, he says, deal with “phenomenal experience,” that is, qualia and the explanatory gap. From this he draws “two morals.” First, he says, “no one should claim that problems of phenomenal experience have been solved by any purely cognitive or neuroscientific theory.” (Here Lycan finds himself in “surprising agreement with Chalmers.”) Second and perhaps more importantly, he says, some of “the theories cannot fairly be criticized for failing to illuminate problems of phenomenal experience”—because that is not what they intend to do, that is, “they may be theories of, say, awareness or of privileged access, not theories of qualia or of subjectivity or of ‘what it’s like’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib514" name="bbib514" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib514"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lycan, 2004</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2850">Lycan defends “the Representational theory of the qualitative features of apparent phenomenal objects: When you see a (real) ripe banana and there is a corresponding yellow patch in your visual field, the yellowness ‘of’ the patch is, like the banana itself, a representatum, an intentional object of the experience. The experience represents the banana and it represents the <em>yellowness of the banana</em>, and the latter yellowness is all the yellowness that is involved; there is no mental patch that is itself yellow.

But one cannot explain what one cannot express in the first place. (The existence of ineffable facts is no embarrassment to science or to materialism, so long as they are fine-grained ‘facts,’ incorporating modes of presentation.)” Second, he says, “the Gap is not confined to consciousness in any sense or even to mind; there are many kinds of intrinsically perspectival (fine-grained) facts that cannot be explained” (without first conceding a pre-existing identity) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib514" name="bbib514" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib514"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lycan, 2004</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2860">In their review, Thomas Polger and Owen Flanagan describe Lycan's view as, roughly, that “conscious beings are hierarchically composed intentional systems, whose representational powers are to be understood in terms of their biological function.” They call the view “teleological functionalism” or “teleofunctionalism” and state “the homuncular part, for which Lycan and Daniel Dennett argued convincingly, is now so widely accepted that it fails to distinguish Lycan's view from other versions of functionalism.

And: Do qualia pose a special problem?” Lycan answers the first question on consciousness by defending an “inner sense account of consciousness,” holding that "consciousness is the functioning of internal attention mechanisms directed at lower-order psychological states and events." Jackson is less satisfied by Lycan's rejection of the knowledge argument, which Jackson calls “the most forceful way of raising the problem posed by qualia for physicalism.” (Jackson says this “as someone who no longer accepts the argument”) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib401" name="bbib401" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib401"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jackson, 1997</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2870">According to Jackson, Lycan is confident that phenomenal nature is exhausted by functional role. In other words, “for Lycan, it is very hard for functional nature to fail to exhaust phenomenal nature. Almost anything you might cite as escaping the functional net is, by his lights, functional after all.” Moreover, Lycan has “the nature of conscious experience exhausted by the intentional contents or representational nature of the relevant kinds of mental states” in that “the representational facts which make up a package [is] sufficient to capture in full the perceptual experience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib401" name="bbib401" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib401"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jackson, 1997</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2875">Lycan attacks neurobiological conventional wisdom in that “all too often we hear it suggested that advances in neuroscience will solve Thomas Nagel's and Frank Jackson's conceptual problem of “knowing what it’s like.” To Lycan, “this is grievously confused. For Nagel's and Jackson's claim is precisely that there is an irreducible kind of phenomenal knowledge that cannot be revealed by science of any kind. Nagel's and Jackson's respective ‘Knowledge Arguments’ for this radical thesis are purely philosophical; they contain no premises that depend on scientific fact.” Lycan now presses his sharp point. “Either the arguments are unsound or they are sound. If they are unsound, then so far as has been shown, there is no such irreducible knowledge, and neither science nor anything else is needed to produce it. But if the arguments are sound, they show that no amount of science could possibly help to produce the special phenomenal knowledge. Either way, neither neuroscience nor any other science is pertinent.”</p><p id="p2880">Lycan seems sure that the “what it’s like to be” and knowledge arguments are unsound and he can go about formulating his Representational theory of mind standing squarely in the materialist camp.

The presentation of sensible properties is just all there is to the phenomenal quality of a state of appearing. No properties of the subject (insofar as it is the subject of this state) or of the state itself contribute to this phenomenal quality.” He defends “surprising consequences” of the Transparency Thesis. First, “one has to give up the idea of the first-person-perspective as a kind of inner seeming or appearing directed onto mental states (at least, if the relevant states are states of appearing).” Next, two assumptions entailed in numerous popular accounts of phenomenal consciousness are negated: (i) “phenomenal qualities are properties of states of appearing that are independent or partly independent of the (sensible) properties presented in these states; ” and (ii) “there can be phenomenally conscious states of appearing even though there is nothing that is presented to their subjects” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib267" name="bbib267" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib267"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Franken, n.d.</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.8.11"><h4 id="sectitle0495" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.8.11.

These philosophers held that sensations are contingently identical with brain processes, where sensations are understood to be conscious states such as pain or the visual experience of red.” The identity here was taken to be contingent, in part, because “it was taken to be clear that scientific type-type identities generally are contingent.” Smart's example was that he could imagine that lightning is not an electrical discharge. (These claims are mistaken, Tye says; “If in actual fact lightning is an electrical discharge, it could not have been otherwise.”) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib807" name="bbib807" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib807"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tye, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2920">Tye says, “the contingentist about consciousness agrees with the above remarks concerning lightning and is happy to extend them to many other scientific identity statements. But the contingentist holds that the case of conscious mental states—states such that there is something it is <em>like</em> to undergo them—is different. Here the claim is not that such states are contingently identical with brain processes, but that such states are contingently identical with physical states of some sort or other, where the notion of a physical state is to be understood broadly to include not only neurophysiological states but also other states that are grounded in microphysical states, including functional states or states of the sort posited by representationalism, for example. For conscious states, the identities are contingent since we can easily imagine their having not obtained. For example, we can easily imagine a zombie undergoing the physical state with which the experience of fear is to be identified and yet not experiencing fear at all. Similarly, we can easily imagine someone experiencing fear without undergoing the given physical state” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib807" name="bbib807" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib807"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tye, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2925">The solution, Tye suggests, “lies with the realization that it is a mistake to model the consciousness case on that of physical-physical relationships.

That is certainly intelligible to us. But it creates no explanatory puzzle; for that is only a metaphysically possible world. It is not the actual world.

According to Tye, “The two dominant theories of consciousness argue it appeared in living beings either suddenly, or gradually. Both theories face problems. The solution is the realization that a foundational consciousness was always here, yet varying conscious states were not, and appeared gradually.” Given that it is hardly obvious how to discern which organisms are conscious, and, if so, their kind or level of consciousness, borderline cases of consciousness can make no sense. As David Papineau reviews Tye, “But this isn't because a sharp line is found somewhere as we move from non-conscious physical systems to conscious ones. Rather [according to Tye] it's because no such line exists at all.

Conscious experience exists only for the conscious system, so is categorically subjective, and its basic elements are irreducibly qualitative. As a general rule, he says, we don't find representational content in the world it participates in representing, which can help explain subjectivity. Moreover, following Metzinger's concept of an “untranscendable object,” a representational system must have epistemic primitives that resist further representation on pain of a metabolically expensive representational regress. This can help explain the non-decomposable, monadic character of basic sensory qualities such as red, sweet, pain, etc. Developments in the science of representation and representational content, he says, may (or may not) vindicate the Content Hypothesis. Clark says that his model is consistent with Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Predictive Processing, all of which involve representation (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib159" name="bbib159" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib159"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Clark, T., 2019</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib161" name="bbib161" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib161"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p2995">Clark, a proponent of naturalism as a worldview (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib155" name="bbib155" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib155"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Clark, T., 2007</span></span></a>), believes that a materialist can see that “consciousness, as a strictly physical phenomenon instantiated by the brain, creates a world subjectively immune to its own disappearance … it is the very finitude of a self-reflective cognitive system that bars it from witnessing its own beginning or ending, and hence prevents there being, <em>for it</em>, any condition other than existing” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib154" name="bbib154" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib154"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Clark, T., 1994</span></span></a>).

The end of one's own consciousness, he offers, “is only an event, and its non-existence a current fact, from other perspectives.” After death we won't experience non-being, he says, we won't ‘fade to black’.

Language relationships</h3><p id="p3015">Language Relationships discern connections, causal and other, between consciousness and language. Language obviously enriches the content of consciousness, perhaps provides a framework for human consciousness, but is there a deeper relationship? Does consciousness <em>require</em> language, in that if there is no language capability there can be no inner experience? Conversely, does language <em>require</em> consciousness, in that if there is no inner experience, there can be no language capability? (Note that while language does not generate theories of consciousness per se, it features in some and is rejected in others, both of which are worth exploring.)</p><p id="p3020">Much depends on careful definitions. To take the consciousness-requires-language causal paradigm, if by consciousness we mean phenomenal consciousness, raw inner experience only, then if we claim that language is required, then our claim would limit phenomenal consciousness, inner experience, to human beings and would exclude all (or at least almost all) other animals. Argue this to a happy dog owner and you will confront an angry dog owner.</p><p id="p3025">To take the language-requires-consciousness causal paradigm, with a definition of language sufficiently loose to subsume computer languages or communications between paramecia or signals between embryonic stem cells, consciousness would not be required.</p><p id="p3030">The philosophical debate regarding whether language is necessary for consciousness has a long and meandering history. Many argue that consciousness does not at all require language; others, that consciousness is facilitated by language or even is not possible without it. A contemporary consensus is building around the idea that increasing levels of consciousness, ranging from unconsciousness to highly conscious reflective self-awareness, requires increasing use of language. What follows would be that language is not needed for pure phenomenal consciousness, a general state of awareness, or in responding to external stimuli—such as in preverbal infants—but phenomenal consciousness would be needed for complex expressions of consciousness, like self-awareness, information integration, and metaconsciousness, which are based on language-powered capacities, especially inner speech (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib396" name="bbib396" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib396"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ivory Research, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3035">Because we sense that many animal species are conscious—much like we assume that other humans are conscious like we are conscious—and we know that language is much more restricted, to humans and, in a lesser sense, some other animals (e.g., primates, cetaceans, birds), this would seem to weaken the consciousness-language nexus.

Chomsky's language and consciousness</h4><p id="p3070">Philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky revolutionized the theory of language, and although language-related theory of consciousness has not been a focus of his contributions, its relevance remains. Chomsky famously posited linguistic capacity, especially syntactic knowledge, as at least partially innate and mostly (if not entirely) unique to human beings. Thus, language acquisition in all human children is somewhat instinctual and surprisingly rapid, conditioned by language-specific features of diverse languages. Chomsky labels this core set of inherited grammatical rules “universal grammar” and characterizes these inborn, subconscious capabilities as “deep structure”.</p><p id="p3075">Does Chomsky's universal grammar with its deep structure carry implications for consciousness? How does Chomsky approach the hard problem of phenomenal consciousness? His views are complex, not easily categorized (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib144" name="bbib144" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib144"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chomsky, 2022a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib145" name="bbib145" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib145"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2022b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib246" name="bbib246" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib246"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2010</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib251" name="bbib251" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib251"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2022b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3080">Chomsky is an aggressive critic of behaviorism—it makes no sense, he says, to study internal phenomena by observing external manifestations. The study of language is entirely inconsistent with behaviorist principles. “Nothing there,” he says. To understand it, one must examine internal processes. Thus, the connection between the deep structure of language and the essence of consciousness.</p><p id="p3085">Chomsky is also a critic of the hard problem, labeling it a “pseudo-problem.” Some questions, by their simple structures, are not real questions, he says, in that there is no logical way to answer them. His example question “Why do things happen?” cannot be answered in the general, while a similar-sounding question, say, “Why did this earthquake happen?” can be answered in the specific. Chomsky believes that the hard problem of consciousness is an example of the former and therefore is not a genuine question (while the “easy” problems of consciousness, discovering neural correlates, are examples of the latter).</p><p id="p3090">Exemplifying Chomsky's unorthodox approach to consciousness, even though he commits to a materialism/physicalism ontology that the mind is generated only in the brain, rather than deflating the ontological status of the mental, his contrarian position is to challenge the ontological status of the physical—arguing that science does not know what matter really is. To Chomsky, matter, not mental, is the main mystery.</p><p id="p3095">As Chomsky says, “The mind-body problem can be posed sensibly only insofar as we have a definite conception of body. If we have no such definite and fixed conception, we cannot ask whether some phenomena fall beyond its range” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib142" name="bbib142" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib142"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chomsky, 1987</span></span></a>). Moreover, “The mind-body problem can therefore not even be formulated. The problem cannot be solved, because there is no clear way to state it. Unless someone proposes a definite concept of body, we cannot ask whether some phenomena exceed its bounds.”</p><p id="p3100">As for clarifying the concept of the body, the physical, matter, Chomsky states, “the material world is whatever we discover it to be, with whatever properties it must be assumed to have for the purposes of explanatory theory. Any intelligible theory that offers genuine explanations and that can be assimilated to the core notions of physics becomes part of the theory of the material world, part of our account of body.”</p><p id="p3105">To Chomsky, a mechanical model of the world, developed in early modern philosophy and inchoate science, could never account for aspects of the mental. Thus, while he understands Descartes' motivation to postulate a separate, nonphysical “thinking substance,” he rejects Descartes’ classic dualism and trains his analytic guns on the mechanical model in particular and on matter in general.</p><p id="p3110">Chomsky feels no pressure to devise his own theory of consciousness. If anything, he shuns grand solutions. “There seems to be no coherent doctrine of materialism and metaphysical naturalism, no issue of eliminativism, no mind-body problem (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib143" name="bbib143" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib143"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chomsky, 2020</span></span></a>).

Chomsky is content to allow science to do its work, advancing knowledge of the brain and of the mind, leaving to the future the construction of proper theories of consciousness irrespective of current notions of the physical and matter.</p><p id="p3115">One may infer that Chomsky contemplates an expanded view of the physical, with matter having features now unknown, which then would “naturally” subsume the mental. (Note: Chomsky rejects panpsychism.) However, in an overarching sense, he remains unsure whether human beings have the capacity to solve what he believes are genuine mysteries about the nature of reality, but he is also unsure whether consciousness will prove to be an ultimate mystery.</p></section><section id="sec9.9.2"><h4 id="sectitle0525" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.9.2.

They can smell things I can't smell and they have a kind of inner life that I don't have, but all the same, there are all kinds of conscious experiences they simply cannot have. My doggy lying there may be thinking about chasing other dogs but he's not thinking about doing his income tax or writing his next poem or figuring out how he's going to have a better summer vacation next year.”</p><p id="p3130">Searle stresses how language gives us enormous power in shaping consciousness. A favorite quotation is from the French philosopher La Rochefoucauld: “Very few people would ever fall in love if they never read about it.” Searle's point is that language shapes experience; there are all kinds of experiences you just can't have without language.</p><p id="p3135">As for how language and consciousness articulate and developed over time, Searle envisions an evolutionary “boot-strapping effect.” It starts off with pre-linguistic consciousness, and then develops linguistic meaning and communication, which enrich consciousness. The result is an elaborate structure of language, which makes for a more elaborate structure of consciousness, which then enables you to enrich your language. There is a continuous reinforcing and compound effect (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib691" name="bbib691" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib691"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Searle, 2014b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3140">Non-linguistic animals can't do this, Searle continues: “My doggie can think somebody is at the door, but he cannot think I wish 17 people were at the door, or I hope we get more people at the door next week.

The “passing show,” he says, “gets assembled into larger, more meaningful groups when we use language to classify and categorize.” How do we do this? How do we connect up these bits of consciousness with something stable? How do we classify the world, not just our own experience, and communicable between experiencers? The answer is language, he says, which he calls a species-specific property of human beings.

One can lose the word for an object but can still recognize the object (a form of aphasia). Deeper, one can not only lose the word as a piece of sound representing an object, but also not recognize the object either and lose the whole meaning (a form of agnosia). He describes stroke patients who, for example, can't use the word “glove”. “What is that?” “Can't say.” Perhaps just the word is missing, because if they are asked, “Is there a glove on the table?”, they answer, “Yes.” But other stroke patients answer, “I've no idea.” And if you show them a glove and ask, “What's this for?”, they say, “I don't know, maybe it's for keeping coins.”</p><p id="p3175">Smith suggests that words are ways that our visual consciousness categorizes and structures the world. And perhaps a deeper loss of language can lead to a dissolution of the very categories that we use to classify our perceptual experiences. So, it's not just that I can't name or categorize some object, but without language the actual conscious experience of that object is radically different. If so, language is responsible, at least in part, for organizing consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib717" name="bbib717" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib717"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Smith, 2012</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.9.5"><h4 id="sectitle0540" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.9.5. Jaynes's breakdown of the bicameral mind</h4><p id="p3180">Psychohistorian Julian Jaynes's 1976 book, <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em>, proposes that consciousness, particularly "the ability to introspect," is a learned behavior rooted in language and culture and arises from metaphor; consciousness is neither innate nor fundamental. To Jaynes, language plays a central role in consciousness; language is “an organ of perception, not simply a means of communication” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib413" name="bbib413" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib413"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1976</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib788" name="bbib788" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib788"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bicameral Mind, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3185">Jaynes defines consciousness idiosyncratically by distinguishing it from sensory awareness and cognition; as such it more closely resembles “introspective consciousness,” as he calls it, than it does phenomenal consciousness, which is the target of this Landscape. Nonetheless, it is helpful to work through Jaynes's definitions and arguments, clarifying how to avoid what could be confounding or muddled thinking about consciousness. While Jaynes's consciousness is not phenomenal consciousness, his careful parsing of his definition gives insight into the subtleties of the parsing process. Moreover, appreciating the flow of Jaynes's arguments as well as the substance of his claims sharpens our view of the entire Landscape.</p><p id="p3190">In Jaynes's words, “Consciousness is not a simple matter and it should not be spoken of as if it were.” He starts with what his consciousness is not. (i) Not the “many things that the nervous system does automatically for us. All the variety of perceptual constancies … all done without any help from introspective consciousness.” (ii) Not what he calls “preoptive” activities, such as how we sit, walk, move. “All these are done without consciousness, unless we decide to be conscious of them.” (iii) Not even speaking, where “the role of consciousness is more interpolative than any constant companion to my words.” Consciousness, he stresses, is not sense perception; it does not copy experience; it is not necessary for learning; it is not even necessary for thinking or reasoning; and it has only an arbitrary and functional location (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib414" name="bbib414" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib414"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3195">To Jaynes, consciousness, or what he refines as “subjective conscious mind,” is an analog of the real world. “It is built up with a vocabulary or lexical field whose terms are all metaphors or analogs of behavior in the physical world … It allows us to short-cut behavioral processes and arrive at more adequate decisions. Like mathematics, it is an operator rather than a thing or a repository. And it is intimately bound with volition and decision … Every word we use to refer to mental events is a metaphor or analog of something in the behavioral world” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib414" name="bbib414" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib414"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3200">Jaynes says that the primary feature of his consciousness is an “associated spatial quality that, as a result of the language used to describe such psychological events, becomes, with constant repetition, this spatial quality of our consciousness or <em>mind-space</em> …. It is the space which you preoptively are introspecting on at this very moment.”</p><p id="p3205">The second most important feature of Jaynes' consciousness is the subject of the introspecting, the <em>introspective “I</em>”. Here Jaynes uses analogy, which differs from metaphor in that the similarity is between relationships rather than between things or actions. “As the body with its sense organs (referred to as I) is to physical seeing,” he says, “so there develops automatically an analog ‘I’ to relate to this mental kind of ‘seeing’ in mind-space.”</p><p id="p3210">A third feature of Jaynes' consciousness is <em>narratization</em>, “the analogic simulation of actual behavior.” Consciousness, he says, “is constantly fitting things into a story, putting a before and an after around any event.” Other features of Jaynes' consciousness include: “<em>concentration</em>, the ‘inner’ analog of external perceptual attention; <em>suppression</em>, by which we stop being conscious of annoying thoughts, the analog of turning away from annoyances in the physical world; <em>excerption</em>, the analog of how we sense only one aspect of a thing at a time; and <em>consilience</em>, the analog of perceptual assimilation.” Jaynes “essential rule” is that “no operation goes on in consciousness that was not in behavior first. All of these are learned analogs of external behavior” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib414" name="bbib414" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib414"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3215">Definition in hand, Jaynes asks, “When did all this ‘inner’ world begin?”, which he calls “the most important watershed in our discussion.”</p><p id="p3220">Jaynes famously introduces the hypothesis of the "bicameral mind", a non-conscious mentality supposedly prevalent in early humans that featured a kind of auditory hallucinations. He argued that relatively recent human ancestors as late as the ancient Greeks did not consider emotions and desires as stemming from their own minds but rather as the actions of external gods (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib47" name="bbib47" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib47"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bicameral mentality, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3225">Jaynes takes the oldest parts of the Iliad and asks, “Is there evidence of consciousness?” The answer, he thinks, is no. “People are not sitting down and making decisions. No one is. No one is introspecting. No one is even reminiscing. It is a very different kind of world” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib414" name="bbib414" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib414"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3230">Who, then, makes the decisions? Whenever a significant choice is to be made, Jaynes suggests that “a voice comes in telling people what to do. These voices are always and immediately obeyed. These voices are called gods.” To Jaynes, this is the origin of gods. He regards them as “auditory hallucinations” similar to, although not the same as, “the voices heard by Joan of Arc or William Blake. Or similar to the voices that modern schizophrenics hear.”</p><p id="p3235">Jaynes coins the “bicameral mind” using the metaphor of a bicameral legislature. It simply means that human mentality at this time was in two parts, a decision-making part and a follower part, and neither part was conscious in the sense in which Jaynes has described it (above) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib414" name="bbib414" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib414"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3240">The theory posits that the human mind once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be "speaking", and a second part which listens and obeys—the bicameral mind—and that the breakdown of this division gave rise to consciousness in humans.</p><p id="p3245">Jaynes supports his theory with historical texts and archaeological evidence. He places the origin of consciousness around the 2nd millennium BCE and suggests that the transition from the bicameral mind to consciousness was triggered by the breakdown of the bicameral system of society (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib47" name="bbib47" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib47"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bicameral mentality, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3250">Jaynes describes bicameral societies as “strict and stable hierarchies,” including bicameral theocracies, where “everything went like clockwork providing there was no real catastrophe or problem.” But such a system is precarious, especially as society grows in population and complexity, such that “given a time of social and political instability, bicamerality can break down like a house of cards.” Whereas all significant decisions previously had been based on the bicameral mind, after its breakdown, after the hallucinated voices no longer told people what to do, a new way of making decisions had to develop, which was a kind of proto-consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib414" name="bbib414" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib414"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Jaynes, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3255">There is an obvious, perhaps tempting, neurobiological correlate: the two cerebral hemispheres, especially based on the pioneering split-brain research of Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Sperry, which explained functional brain lateralization and how the cerebral hemispheres communicate with each another.

They reject such “consciousness inessentialism” by appealing to “how the concept of value has been approached in decision-making, emotion research and consciousness research” and by arguing that “phenomenal consciousness has intrinsic value”—such as it being “the central drive for the discovery and creation of new behaviours.” They conclude that consciousness “must have a function” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib165" name="bbib165" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib165"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Cleeremans and Tallon-Baudry, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3395">Under their hypothesis, “consciousness would have evolved and been selected because it adds an important degree of freedom to the machinery of reward-based behaviour: behaviour that seems purposeless from a purely functional perspective nevertheless has intrinsic value.

Andrew's consciousness without complex brains</h4><p id="p3400">Philosopher Kristin Andrews, an expert on animal minds, argues that progress in consciousness studies has been hampered by prevailing conventional wisdom that for an organism to be conscious, a complex brain is required. She advocates moving “past a focus on complex mammalian brains to study the behavior of ‘simpler’ animals” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib17" name="bbib17" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib17"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Andrews, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3405">In forming her argument, Andrews rehearses how Crick and Koch helped turn consciousness studies into a real science by supposing that “higher mammals” possess some essential features of consciousness (9.2.2), by setting aside the still-common Cartesian view that language is needed for conscious experience, and by assuming that a nervous system is necessary for consciousness. She recruits the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, which states that “there is sufficient evidence to conclude that ‘all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses’ experience conscious states.” The Declaration, she notes, identifies five consciousness markers (not all of which would be necessary): “homologous brain circuits; artificial stimulation of brain regions causing similar behaviours and emotional expressions in humans and other animals; neural circuits supporting behavioural/electrophysical states of attentiveness, sleep and decision-making; mirror self-recognition; and similar impacts of hallucinogenic drugs across species” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib17" name="bbib17" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib17"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Andrews, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3410">But Andrews posits that “emphasis on the neurological … may be holding the science back,” and that animal research suggests “<em>multiple realizability</em>—the view that mental capacities can be instantiated by very different physical systems.” If neuroscience looks only at <em>slightly</em> different physical systems (say, just other primates or even mammals), she says, “we may be overlooking the key piece to the consciousness puzzle.”</p><p id="p3415">Andrews asks, “What might we learn if our anthropocentrism didn't lead us to focus on the brain as the relevant part of physiology needed for consciousness, but instead led us to examine the behaviours that are associated with experiences?” She advocates studying “the nature of consciousness by looking at bees, octopuses and worms as research subjects. All these animals have a robust profile of behaviours that warrant the hypothesis that they are conscious. Moving away from painful stimuli, learning the location of desirable nutrients, and seeking out what is needed for reproduction is something we share widely with other animals.” By studying simple animals, she offers, we can simplify research on consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib17" name="bbib17" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib17"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Andrews, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3420">Andrews likens studying consciousness to studying the origin of life on earth and searching for life on other planets. For each, there is only one confirmed instance. It's the “N = 1 problem.” “If we study only one evolved instance of consciousness (our own),” she says, “we will be unable to disentangle the contingent and dispensable from the essential and indispensable.” She offers “good news” in that “consciousness science, unlike the search for extraterrestrial life, can break out of its N = 1 problem using other cases from our own planet.” Typically, consciousness scientists study other primates (e.g., macaque monkeys) and, to a lesser extent, other mammals, such as rats. “But the N = 1 problem still bites here. Because the common ancestor of the primates was very probably conscious, as indeed was the common ancestor of all mammals—we are still looking at the same evolved instance (just a different variant of it). To find independently evolved instances of consciousness, we really need to look to much more distant branches of the tree of life” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib18" name="bbib18" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib18"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Andrews and Birch, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3425">Andrews speculates that “sentience has evolved only three times: once in the arthropods (including crustaceans and insects), once in the cephalopods (including octopuses) and once in the vertebrates.” But she cannot rule out “the possibility that the last common ancestor of humans, bees and octopuses, which was a tiny worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million years ago, was itself sentient—and that therefore sentience has evolved only once on Earth.”</p><p id="p3430">In either case, she argues, “If a marker-based approach does start pointing towards sentience being present in our worm-like last common ancestor, we would have evidence against current theories that rely on a close relationship between sentience and special brain regions adapted for integrating information, like the cerebral cortex in humans.

Conversely, it could mean that sentience is related to some unknown feature(s).</p><p id="p3435">To Andrews, the philosophy of animal minds addresses profound questions about the nature of mind as they cut across animal cognition and philosophy of mind. Key topics include the evolution of consciousness, tool use in animals, animal culture, mental representation, belief, communication, theory of mind, animal ethics, and moral psychology (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib15" name="bbib15" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib15"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Andrews, 2020a</span></span></a>).

Whereas the common assumption is that consciousness is (somehow) related to the complexity of the nervous system, but because all neurobiological advances, collectively, have not progressed in solving the hard problem, then perhaps the common assumption is not correct and the generation of consciousness can be found outside the nervous system. Thus, rather than assuming that organisms without complex nervous systems cannot be conscious, perhaps a radical new approach might be to consider that these organisms are (in a way) conscious and focus research on how such “lower” or “primitive” consciousness might come about.</p><p id="p3450">Finally, regarding our current obsession with discerning AI sentience, Andrews claims that “without a deep understanding of the variety of animal minds on this planet, we will almost certainly fail” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib18" name="bbib18" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib18"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Andrews and Birch, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3455">Neuroscience/consciousness writer Annaka Harris goes further, questioning our potentially false but deeply ingrained intuition that “systems that act like us are conscious, and those that don't are not.” Plants and philosophical zombies, she says, indicate that this human-centric intuition “has no real foundation.” (A. <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib350" name="bbib350" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib350"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Harris, 2020</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib349" name="bbib349" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib349"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2019</span></span></a>).

They have minds, though they are tiny and limited in scope.” He rejects that “minds are computational and can be captured by an artificial intelligence.” He develops CBC using standard models of evolutionary biology, leveraging the “remarkable repertoire of single-celled species that micro- and cell-biologists have discovered … Bacteria, for example, have sophisticated sensory and perceptual systems, learn, form memories, make decisions based on information about their environment relative to internal metabolic states, communicate with each other, and even show a primitive form of altruism.” All such functions, Reber contends, “are indicators of sentience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib642" name="bbib642" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib642"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Reber, 2016</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib643" name="bbib643" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib643"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3465">Reber's model is based on a simple, radical axiom: “Mind and consciousness are not unique features of human brains.

Organisms have minds, or the precursors of what we from our philosophy of mind perspective think of as minds, because they are an inherent component of organic form.

Feinberg and Mallatt's ancient origins of consciousness</h4><p id="p3490">Neurologist/psychiatrist Todd Feinberg and evolutionary biologist Jon Mallatt propose that consciousness appeared much earlier in evolutionary history than is commonly assumed, and therefore all vertebrates and perhaps even some invertebrates are conscious. By assembling a list of the biological and neurobiological features that seem responsible for consciousness, and by juxtaposing the fossil record of evolution, the authors argue that about 520–560 million years ago, “the great ‘Cambrian explosion’ of animal diversity produced the first complex brains, which were accompanied by the first appearance of consciousness; simple reflexive behaviors evolved into a unified inner world of subjective experiences” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib252" name="bbib252" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib252"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Fineberg and Mallatt, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3495">Doing what they call “neuroevolution,” Feinberg and Mallatt put forth the even more unconventional idea that the origin of consciousness goes back to the origin of life, in that single-cell creatures respond to stimuli from the environment, whether attracted to food sources or repelled by harmful chemicals. The authors call this process “sensory consciousness” [but which others may call stimulus-response patterns unworthy of the “consciousness” appellation]. In addition, the cell membrane distinguishes self from non-self, which becomes another baby step on the long evolutionary journey to human consciousness. A crucial developmental step, they say, was the evolution of “hidden layers” of clusters of intermediary nerve cells that process and relay internal signals between sensory-input and motor-output nerve cells. Driven by evolutionary pressures, these clusters would go on to evolve into primitive and then more complex brains (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib252" name="bbib252" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib252"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Fineberg and Mallatt, 2016</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib656" name="bbib656" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib656"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Rose, 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3500">If indeed these were the historical facts, it would naturally follow that “all vertebrates are and have always been conscious—not just humans and other mammals, but also every fish, reptile, amphibian, and bird.” Moreover, Feinberg and Mallatt find that many invertebrates—arthropods (including insects and probably crustaceans) and cephalopods (including the octopus)—"meet many of the criteria for consciousness.” Their proposal challenges standard-model theory that “consciousness evolved simultaneously but independently in the first vertebrates and possibly arthropods more than half a billion years ago.” Combining evolutionary, neurobiological, and philosophical approaches enables Feinberg and Mallatt to cast a broader group of animals that are conscious, though it is less clear how their theory offers—as the marketing claims, the authors less so—“an original solution to the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib252" name="bbib252" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib252"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Fineberg and Mallatt, 2016</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.10.8"><h4 id="sectitle0590" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.10.8. Levin's technological approach to mind everywhere</h4><p id="p3505">Developmental and synthetic biologist Michael Levin introduces “a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates,” which he calls ‘TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere.” He asserts that creating “novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software”—via synthetic biology and bioengineering—“are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species.” TAME, Levin says, “formalizes a non-binary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency,” and it “provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib499" name="bbib499" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib499"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Levin, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3510">By focusing on cognitive function, not on phenomenal or access consciousness, Levin takes “TAME's view of sentience as fundamentally tied to goal-directed activity,” noting carefully that “only some aspects of which can be studied via third-person approaches.” Provisionally, Levin suggests that consciousness “comes in degrees and kinds (is not binary),” for the same reasons he argues for continuity of cognition: “if consciousness is fundamentally embodied, the plasticity and gradual malleability of bodies suggest that it is a strong requirement for proponents of phase transitions to specify what kind of ‘atomic’ (not further divisible) bodily change makes for a qualitative shift in capacity consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib499" name="bbib499" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib499"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Levin, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3515">Although Levin takes the null or default hypothesis to be the relatively smooth continuity of consciousness across species and phylogenetically, he hedges that “the TAME framework is not incompatible with novel discoveries about sharp phase transitions.” He points to future, radical brain-computer interfaces in human patients as “perhaps one avenue where a subject undergoing such a change can convince themselves, and perhaps others, that a qualitative, not continuous, change in their consciousness had occurred.”</p><p id="p3520">In a radical implication of TAME, Levin argues that “while ‘embodiment’ is critical for consciousness, it is not restricted to physical bodies acting in 3D space, but also includes perception-action systems working in all sorts of spaces.” This implies, he says, “counter to many people's intuitions, that systems that operate in morphogenetic, transcriptional, and other spaces should also have some (if very minimal) degree of consciousness. This in turn suggests that an agent, such as a typical modern human, is really a patchwork of many diverse consciousnesses, only one of which is usually capable of verbally reporting its states (and, not surprisingly, given its limited access and self-boundary, believes itself to be a unitary, sole owner of the body).”</p><p id="p3525">Levin remains “skeptical about being able to say anything definitive about consciousness per se (as distinct from correlates of consciousness) from a 3rd-person, objective perspective.” Yet, he muses, “The developmental approach to the emergence of consciousness on short, ontogenetic timescales complements the related question on phylogenetic timescales, and is likely to be a key component of mature theories in this field” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib499" name="bbib499" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib499"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Levin, 2022</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec9.10.9"><h4 id="sectitle0595" class="u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">9.10.9. No hard problem in William James's psychology</h4><p id="p3530">Writer Tracy Witham argues that William James flipped the paradigm in which the hard problem arises, because James viewed consciousness through a problem he believed it solves by selecting for adaptive responses to specific environmental situations (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib407" name="bbib407" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib407"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 1890</span></span></a>). Essentially, James believed that a brain complex enough to support a proliferation of options for responding to environmental situations is more likely to obscure than to identify the best option to use, unless that brain also has a selection mechanism for choosing adaptive over less, non-, and maladaptive options. But the question remains, Witham says, whether consciousness is, at least, a good prima facie fit, to address what can be called “the selection problem.”</p><p id="p3535">The hypothesis that underlies James's view, she says, is that consciousness increases an organism's fitness by “bringing … pressure to bear in favor of those of its performances which make for the most permanent interests of the brain's owner …” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib407" name="bbib407" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib407"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 1890</span></span></a>, p. 140).</p><p id="p3540">Specifically, the role James gave to consciousness must be understood only in the context of the formation of de facto ends which he believed form when preferred sensations are recalled in their absence (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib407" name="bbib407" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib407"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 1890</span></span></a>, p. 78). This context is crucial, because it is consciousness that confers the preferences for some sensations over others and thereby serves as the source of the ends. But to understand why James gave consciousness that role, Witham says we need to understand his two-word phrase, "cerebral reflex," (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib407" name="bbib407" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib407"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 1890</span></span></a>, p. 80). which implies a stimulus-and-response schema is the basis for the ends-and-means couplings that form cerebral reflexes. However, there is a problem with the implication. For this to work, ends must stand in for stimuli, arising in interactions between organisms and their environments.</p><p id="p3545">The problem is solved, Witham says, if consciousness just is what it seems to be: the means by which we reflect on our interactions with our environments to sense whether the interactions are favorable or not. So, what consciousness seems to be fits James's hypothesis perfectly, that its role is to "bring … pressure to bear [in favor of] those of our performances" that are adaptive. Reflective experience, in short, makes it possible to identify experiences of our environmental interactions that contain adaptive behaviors and retain them as cerebral reflexes for future use. But then, as the means to solve the selection problem, consciousness becomes an adaptive adaptation in the sense of being an adaptation selecting for adaptive behaviors. And it does so by being, indeed, what it seems to be: an adaptive adaptation that is a marvelous source of solutions, not a confounding source of problems.</p><p id="p3550">The critical question, however, is whether a zombie-like black box of sufficient complexity could perform environmentally driven, fitness enhancing, evolutionarily successful activities, and if so, why then the radical advent of something so startlingly novel in the universe: inner experience? In other words, while the question of why consciousness was favored and selected by evolution is important, it is not the question of what consciousness actually <em>is</em>, which of course is the hard problem.</p></section></section></section><section id="sec10"><h2 id="sectitle0600" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">10. Non-reductive physicalism</h2><p id="p3555">Non-Reductive Physicalism takes consciousness to be entirely physical, solely the product of biological brains, but mental states or properties are irreducibly distinct from physical states or properties such that they cannot be entirely explained by physical laws, principles or discoveries (in brains or otherwise) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib517" name="bbib517" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib517"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Macdonald and Macdonald, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3560">Non-reductive Physicalism was, in part, a response to conceptual problems in the early identity theories of physicalism where mental properties or kinds were literally the same thing as physical properties or kinds. This was challenged by several conceptual conundrums: the multiple realizability of the same mental properties or kinds by different physical properties or kinds (Hilary Putnam); the intentional essence of mental phenomena, which seems so radically different from physical laws or things (Donald Davidson's “Anomalous Monism,” 14.2); and the apparent unbridgeable gap between physics and the special sciences (Jerry Fodor) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib517" name="bbib517" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib517"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Macdonald and Macdonald, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3565">While mental states are generated entirely by physical states (of the brain), non-reductive physicalism maintains that they are truly other than physical; mental states are ontologically distinct.</p><p id="p3570">This would seem to make Non-Reductive Physicalism a form of property dualism (15.1) in that both recognize real mental states and yet only one kind of substance, matter—but, as expected, some adherents of each reject the claims of the other. If Non-Reductive Physicalism is indeed a form of property dualism, it would be perhaps the predominant contemporary kind.</p><p id="p3575">A core mechanism of Non-Reductive Physicalism is emergence, where novel properties at higher levels of integration are not discernible (and perhaps not even predictable, ever) from all-you-can-know at lower or more fundamental levels. A prime feature of Non-Reductive Physicalism is often “top-down causation,” where the content of consciousness is causally efficacious—qualia can do real work (contra Epiphenomenalism, 9.1.2).</p><p id="p3580">Some Christian philosophers, such as Nancey Murphy (10.2), who seek greater consonance between contemporary science and the Christian faith, look to Non-Reductive Physicalism as a nondualistic account of the human person. It does not consider the "soul" an entity separable from the body, such that scientific statements about the physical nature of human beings would be referring to exactly the same entity as theological statements concerning the spiritual nature of human beings (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib91" name="bbib91" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib91"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Brown et al., 1998</span></span></a>).

The problem, according to Kim, is that when these three commitments are combined, an inconsistency is generated that entails the causal impotence of mental properties (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib448" name="bbib448" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib448"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kim, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3595">I've always been puzzled by Non-Reductive Physicalism in that I can well understand how, under physicalism, consciousness is non-reductive in practice, but how non-reductive in principle?

While he calls consciousness “the biggest unsolved problem in science,” he sees the larger vision that consciousness transforms the nature of existence itself such that existence is quite different than it might have been had there been only nonconscious matter (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib234" name="bbib234" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib234"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3605">Ellis begins with four kinds of entities, or “Worlds,” whose existence requires explanation: matter and forces, consciousness, physical and biological possibilities, and mathematical reality. An adequate explanation of what exists, he says, must encompass all four kinds of entities, in two forms: generic forms of the kinds of entities that might exist, and specific instantiations of some of these possibilities that actually occur or have occurred in the real universe. The first are possibilities, and the second are actualizations of those possibilities (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib235" name="bbib235" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib235"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3610">“Possibility spaces,” then, show what is and what is not possible for entities of whatever kind we are discussing. For example, the possibility space for classical physics is all possible states of the system; for quantum physics, the state spaces for the system wave function are Hilbert spaces.</p><p id="p3615">For consciousness, possibility spaces include separate subspaces for all possible thoughts, all possible qualia, all possible emotions—each with its own character. Ellis says, “The rationale is always the same: if these aspects of consciousness occur, then it is possible that they occur; and that possibility was there long before they ever occurred, and so is an abstract feature of the universe. The physical existence of brains enables their potential existence to be actualized” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib235" name="bbib235" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib235"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3620">Ellis embeds his theory of consciousness in the presence and power of strong emergence, where properties of a system are impossible to predict in terms of the properties of its constituents, even in principle; and of top-down causation, where higher hierarchical levels exert causal force on lower levels, even though the higher levels are comprised only of the lower levels. Strong emergence, according to Ellis, works throughout the physical world, particularly in biology where the whole is more than just the sum of its parts (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib237" name="bbib237" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib237"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2017b</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib238" name="bbib238" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib238"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3625">He explains that “emergence is possible because downward causation takes place right down to the lower physical levels, hence, arguments from the alleged causal completeness of physics and supervenience are wrong. Lower levels, including the underlying physical levels, are conscripted to higher level purposes; the higher levels are thereby causally effective, so strong emergence occurs. No violation of physical laws is implied. The key point is that outcomes of universally applicable generic physical laws depend on the context when applied in specific real world biological situations … including the brain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib238" name="bbib238" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib238"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3630">Continuing to focus on emergence and downward causation, Ellis “considers how a classification of causal effects as comprising efficient, formal, material, and final causation can provide a useful understanding of how emergence takes place in biology and technology, with formal, material, and final causation all including cases of downward causation; they each occur in both synchronic and diachronic forms.” Taken together, he says, the four causal effects “underlie why all emergent levels in the hierarchy of emergence have causal powers (which is Noble's principle of biological relativity) and so why causal closure only occurs when the upward and downward interactions between all emergent levels are taken into account, contra to claims that some underlying physics level is by itself causality complete” A key feature, Ellis adds, is that “stochasticity at the molecular level plays an important role in enabling agency to emerge, underlying the possibility of final causation occurring in these contexts” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib239" name="bbib239" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib239"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3635">Ellis's two points here, if veridical and representing reality, would have extraordinary impact on theories of consciousness, and the two bear repeating: (i) emergence has causal powers at all levels in biology, and (ii) top-down causation as well as bottom-up causation is necessary for causal closure. At once, almost every Materialism Theory—maybe <em>every</em> Materialism Theory (more than 90 at last count)—would be shown insufficient to explain consciousness (even if one or more were still necessary to do so).</p><p id="p3640">Ellis highlights questions that he claims reductionists cannot answer: “Reductionists cannot answer why strong emergence (unitary, branching, and logical) is possible, and in particular why abstract entities such as thoughts and social agreements can have causal powers. The reason why they cannot answer these questions is that they do not take into account the prevalence of downward causation in the world, which in fact occurs in physics, biology, the mind, and society” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib237" name="bbib237" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib237"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis 2017b</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib238" name="bbib238" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib238"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3645">David Chalmers distinguishes strong downward causation from weak downward causation. “With strong downward causation, the causal impact of a high-level phenomenon on low-level processes is not deducible even in principle from initial conditions and low-level laws. With weak downward causation, the causal impact of the high-level phenomenon is deducible in principle, but is nevertheless unexpected. As with strong and weak emergence, both strong and weak downward causation are interesting in their own right. But strong downward causation would have more radical consequences for our understanding of nature.” However, Chalmers concludes, “I do not know whether there is any strong downward causation, but it seems to me that if there is any strong downward causation, quantum mechanics is the most likely locus for it … The question remains wide open, however, as to whether or not strong downward causation exists” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib126" name="bbib126" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib126"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2008</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec10.2"><h3 id="sectitle0610" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">10.2.

She takes Non-Reductive Physicalism, a common term in philosophy of mind, to “signal opposition to anthropological dualisms of body and either mind or soul, as well as to physicalist accounts that reduce humans to <em>nothing but</em> complex animals.” She sets herself the task of showing that “<em>non</em>-reductive physicalism is philosophically defensible, compatible with mainstream cognitive neuroscience, and is also acceptable biblically and theologically”—a task made more difficult because she must be able to explain “how Christians for centuries could have been wrong in believing dualism to be biblical teaching” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib556" name="bbib556" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib556"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Murphy, 2017</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib557" name="bbib557" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib557"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3655">To Murphy, part of the answer lies in translation. She focuses on the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures that dates from around 250 BC. This text translated Hebrew terminology into Greek, and “it then contained terms that, <em>in the minds of Christians influenced by Greek philosophy</em>, referred to constituent <em>parts</em> of humans. Later Christians have obligingly read and translated them in this way.” A key instance, she says, is “the Hebrew word <em>nephesh,</em> which was translated as <em>psyche</em> in the Septuagint and later into English as ‘soul’ … In most cases the Hebrew or Greek term is taken simply to be a way of referring to the whole living person” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib557" name="bbib557" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib557"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Murphy, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3660">Murphy is impressed by how many capacities or faculties of the soul, as attributed by Thomas Aquinas, are now well explained by cognitive science and neurobiology. She is moved by “localization studies—that is, research indicating not only <em>that</em> the brain is involved in specific mental operations, but that very specific regions are.”</p><p id="p3665">That gives her the physicalism—the easy part, I'd say. What about the non-reductive—the hard part?</p><p id="p3670">An obvious answer to the problem of neurobiological reductionism, Murphy says, would be the presence and power of downward causation or whole-part causation. That is, if causal reductionism is the thesis that all causation is from part to whole, then the complementary alternative causation would be from whole to part.

And, therefore, dualism seems to me to be an unnecessarily complicated theory about my nature unless there is some fact or phenomenon or aspect of the world that dualism deals with better than materialism does” (which he does not find). As for the argument from phenomenal consciousness, he admits, “It is a mystery how a material thing could have sensuous properties [phenomenal consciousness],” but then retorts, “simply and solely because it is a mystery how <em>anything</em> could.”</p><p id="p3700">Van Inwagen rejects dualism biblically as well as philosophically. After examining biblical texts in the Old Testament, Van Inwagen finds “little to support dualism in the Old Testament, and much that the materialist will find congenial.” His analysis of New Testament texts requires more elaborate (some may say more convoluted) exegesis: “twisting and turning, impaled on intransigent texts,” in Van Inwagen's own self-deprecating words. For example, Jesus's parable of the “Rich Man” and his words to the “Good Thief” on the cross (“Today you shall be with me in Paradise.”). Moreover, Paul's repeated representation of death as “sleep” cannot be discounted.</p><p id="p3705">An important philosophical argument for Christian dualism, Van Inwagen says, is that the doctrine of the Resurrection of the Dead seems to presuppose dualism. “For if I am not something immaterial, if I am a living animal, then death must be the end of me. If I am a living animal, then I am a material object. If I am a material object, then I am the mereological sum of certain atoms. But if I am the mereological sum of certain atoms today, it is clear from what we know about the metabolisms of living things that I was not the sum of those same atoms a year ago” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib811" name="bbib811" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib811"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Van Inwagen, 1995</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3710">For the materialist who believes in the biblical resurrection of the dead as a literal future event, as Van Inwagen does, the fact that the atoms of which we are composed are in continuous flux is a “stumbling block.” He asks, “How shall even omnipotence bring me back—me, whose former atoms are now spread pretty evenly throughout the biosphere?” This question does not confront the dualist, who will say that there is no need to bring me back because I have never left. But what shall the materialist say?” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib811" name="bbib811" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib811"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Van Inwagen, 1995</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3715">Van Inwagen challenges Divine power: “For what can even omnipotence do but <em>reassemble</em>?

The first argument posits that science must use abstract devices integrating past and future moments of continuous time that reflect first-person perception. The second argument tackles the hard problem by examining phenomenal simultaneity, where no time separates experiencer from experienced (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib665" name="bbib665" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib665"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sanfey, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3750">In “something it is like to experience redness,” the experiencer knows they are not simultaneously causing the redness; one cannot consciously cause something without being conscious of doing so, obviously. But an intelligent system not experiencing conscious presence cannot be certain it is not causing what it perceives because its observing self must reside in the same physical systems that may or may not be producing illusions. This suggests, to Sanfey, that experiencing presence is sufficient to create logical possibilities such as disembodied mind or idealism. Rooted in phenomenal simultaneity, these causal mechanics of consciousness are unobservable in principle, he says, making consciousness indistinguishable from strong emergence. Proven causal power means that consciousness can be produced by physical systems even synthetic ones without introducing new physics. (In Sanfey's AR, the brain generates consciousness when two information systems, two electromagnetic fields [9.3], interact bi-directionally, causally, and with sufficient complexity such that one is the observing reference for the other.)

This way, quantum field theory provides formal elements from which a standard classical description of brain activity can be inferred” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3795">Atmanspacher reports applications of quantum concepts to mental processes, focusing on complementarity, entanglement, dispersive states, and non-Boolean logic. These involve quantum-inspired concepts to address purely mental (psychological or cognitive) phenomena, without claiming that actual quantum mechanics is necessary to make it work. This includes research groups studying quantum ideas in cognition (Patra, 2019). While the term “quantum cognition” has gained acceptance, Atmanspacher says that a more appropriate characterization would be “non-commutative structures in cognition,” and he questions whether it is “necessarily true that quantum features in psychology imply quantum physics in the brain?” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3800">After reviewing major quantum theories of consciousness (several are discussed below), Atmanspacher suggests that progress is more likely made by investigating “mental quantum features without focusing on associated brain activity” (at least to begin with). Ultimately, he says, “mind-matter entanglement is conceived as the hypothetical origin of mind-matter correlations. This exhibits the highly speculative picture of a fundamentally holistic, psychophysically neutral level of reality from which correlated mental and material domains emerge” (Atmanspacher's Dual-Aspect Monism, 14.7.).</p><p id="p3805">To position quantum theories of consciousness, consider each as representing one of two forms: (i) quantum processes, similar to those in diverse areas of biology (e.g., photosynthesis), that uniquely empower or enable the special activities of cells, primarily neurons, to generate consciousness; and (ii) the more radical claim that these two great mysteries, consciousness and quantum theory, are intimately connected such that the solution to both mysteries can be solved only together.</p><p id="p3810">Physicist Carlo Rovelli disagrees.

But, “In my view, that works no better than explaining consciousness in terms of classical processes.” However, “Another way is not try to reduce consciousness, but find roles for consciousness in quantum mechanics. That's one of the big questions about consciousness. What does it do? What is it here for? How can it affect the physical world? So, I'm at least taking seriously the idea that maybe consciousness plays a potential role in quantum mechanics. It's a version of the traditional idea that consciousness collapses the wave function.

He is not saying that consciousness is beyond physics, rather that it is beyond today's physics. “Conscious thinking can't be described entirely by the physics that we know,” Penrose said, explaining that he “needed something that had a hope of being non-computational.”<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn36" name="bfn36" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn36"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>36</sup></span></span></a> He focuses on “the main gap in physics”: the contradiction between the continuous, probabilistic evolution given by the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics and the discrete, deterministic events when you make measurements in classical physics—“how rules like Schrödinger's cat being dead and alive at the same time in quantum mechanics do not apply at the classical level” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib94" name="bbib94" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib94"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Penrose, 2014</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib605" name="bbib605" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib605"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023</span></span></a>),</p><p id="p3845">Penrose argues that the missing physics that describes how the quantum world becomes the classical world “is the only place where you could have non-computational activity.” But he admits that it’s “a tall order” to sustain quantum information in the hot, wet brain, because “whenever quantum systems become entangled with the environment, ‘environmental decoherence’ occurs and information is lost.”</p><p id="p3850">“Quantum mechanics acting incoherently is not useful [to account for consciousness],” Penrose explains; “it has to act coherently. That's why we call [our mechanism] ‘Orch OR’, or ‘orchestrated objective reduction’—the ‘OR’ stands for objective reduction, which is where the quantum state collapses to one alternative or another, and ‘Orch’ stands for orchestrated.

Microtubules in all cells enact purposeful spatiotemporal activities, and in the brain, microtubules establish neuronal shape, create and regulate synapses, and are proposed to underlie memory, cognition and consciousness. Tubulin is the brain's most prevalent protein, so the brain is largely made of microtubules, each with unique, high frequency vibrational and quantum properties from non-polar aromatic ring pathways. The claim is made that experimental evidence shows that anti-depressants, psychedelics and general anesthetics, which selectively alter or block consciousness, all act via microtubules (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib89" name="bbib89" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib89"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Brophy and Hameroff, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3870">Some evidence suggests that entangled states can be maintained in noisy open quantum systems at high temperature and far from thermal equilibrium—for example, counterbalancing decoherence by a “recoherence” mechanism—such that, “under particular circumstances, entanglement may persist even in hot and noisy environments such as the brain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).

Adherents posit that Orch OR accounts for cognitive binding, real-time conscious causal action (through non-computable Penrose OR and retroactivity), memory encoding, and, ambitiously, the hard problem of phenomenal experience. Moreover, consciousness as a non-local quantum process in spacetime geometry provides potentially plausible mechanism for near-death and out-of-body experiences, pre-cognition, afterlife and reincarnation (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib89" name="bbib89" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib89"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Brophy and Hameroff, 2023</span></span></a>).

Stapp's collapsing the wave function via asking “questions”</h3><p id="p3895">Mathematical physicist Henry Stapp argues for the quantum nature of consciousness by relying on a traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics, where quantum wave functions collapse only when they interact with consciousness in an act of measurement. He envisions a “mind-like” wave-function collapse that exploits quantum effects in the synapses between neurons, generating consciousness, which he believes is fundamental to the universe (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib728" name="bbib728" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib728"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2011</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib729" name="bbib729" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib729"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2023</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib727" name="bbib727" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib727"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2007</span></span></a>.)</p><p id="p3900">Stapp founds his theory on the transition from the classical-physics conception of reality to von Neumann's application of the principles of quantum physics to our conscious brains (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib726" name="bbib726" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib726"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2006</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib820" name="bbib820" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib820"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Von Neumann, 1955</span></span></a>/1932). Von Neumann extended quantum theory to incorporate the devices and the brain/body of the observers into physical theory, leaving out only the stream of conscious experiences of the agents. According to von Neumann's formulation, “the part of the physically described system being directly acted upon by a psychologically described ‘observer’ is the brain of that observer” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib728" name="bbib728" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib728"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2011</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3905">The quantum jump of the state of an observer's brain to the ‘Yes’ basis state (vector) then becomes the representation, in the state of that brain, of the conscious acquisition of the knowledge associated with that answer ‘Yes,’ which constitutes the neural correlate of that person's conscious experience. This fixes the essential quantum link between consciousness and neuroscience (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib726" name="bbib726" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib726"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3910">To Stapp, this is the key point. “Quantum physics is built around ‘events’ that have both physical and phenomenal aspects. The events are physical because they are represented in the physical/mathematical description by a ‘quantum jump’ to one or another of the basis state vectors defined by the agent/observer's choice of what question to ask. If the resulting event is such that the ‘Yes’ feedback experience occurs then this event ‘collapses’ the prior physical state to a new physical state compatible with that phenomenal experience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib726" name="bbib726" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib726"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3915">Thus, in Stapp's telling, mind and matter thereby become dynamically linked in a way that is causally tied to an agent's free choice of how to act. “A causal dynamical connection is established between (1) a person's conscious choices of how to act, (2) that person's consciously experienced increments in knowledge, and (3) the physical actualizations of the neural correlates of the experienced increments in knowledge” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib726" name="bbib726" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib726"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3920">More colloquially, Stapp argues that given the perspective of classical physics, where all is mechanical, where the physical universe is a closed system, “there's nothing for consciousness to do … and so it must be some sort of an illusion.” Why would there have been consciousness at all, he asks? Under classical physics, “consciousness is just sitting there inert, a passive observer of the scene in which it has no function; it does nothing. So, it's a mystery why consciousness should ever come into existence” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib727" name="bbib727" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib727"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3925">In stark contrast, Stapp says, the way quantum mechanics works, in order to get consequences, predictions, there must be a question posed. It's like “20 questions,” yes-or-no questions. A question is posed in the quantum mechanical scheme; then there is an evolution according to the Schrodinger equation, and then nature gives an answer (which is statistically determined).</p><p id="p3930">The axial idea, Stapp says, is that there is nothing in quantum mechanics that determines what decides the questions. This means that there's a gap, a critical causal gap in quantum mechanics. And the way it's filled in practice is that an observer, on the basis of reasons or motivations or with rules, sets up a certain experiment in a certain way. For example, putting a Geiger counter or some other detector in the path of particles.</p><p id="p3935">This yields Stapp's concept of quantum consciousness. Nobody denies that thoughts exist, he says, but how do they do something? And that's the place where quantum consciousness has causal impact.</p><p id="p3940">The crux of quantum mechanics is what questions are going to be asked. There is nothing in classical physics that asks such questions. But in quantum mechanics questions are answered by the psychological process of the experimenter, who is interested in learning something. And because there is nothing in the way quantum mechanics works that explains the choice of the question, there is an opening for the injection of mental events into the flow of physical events. The choice of the question is not determined by the laws as we know them (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib727" name="bbib727" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib727"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3945">This means we need another process, which is consciousness. And this gives consciousness an actual role to play and allows it to do things causally. And if consciousness can act causally and do things, Stapp says, then classic materialism is out.</p><p id="p3950">Niels Bohr had a famous quote: “one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators.” In the classical worldview, Stapp says, “we were just spectators; always we would just watch what's happening but couldn't do anything. In the quantum mechanical worldview, we are actors. We are needed to make the theory work.”</p><p id="p3955">Moreover, Stapp says, “this mental process cannot just be the product of the brain, because the brain, like all physical things, evolves via quantum mechanical rules. While quantum mechanics describes the evolution of potentialities for events to happen, that's all they describe, only potentialities—they do not describe what chooses the events that are going to happen, the actual events. Something must ask the questions, something outside of quantum mechanics—quantum mechanics forces that process.” The only candidate, Stapp says, must be the independent existence of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib727" name="bbib727" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib727"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3960">Stapp's conclusions are as bold as they are controversial.

Those are two different ideas” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib823" name="bbib823" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib823"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wallace, 2016a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib824" name="bbib824" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib824"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2016b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3970">When Wallace thinks about consciousness collapsing the wave function, as in quantum mechanics, he says, “That's the dualist half of my head. You've got physics, you've got a wave function, and you've got consciousness, which is observing the wave function. And somehow consciousness is something distinct from the physical wave function and every now and then affecting it in this interesting phenomenon of collapse. In a way, it's an updated version of Rene Descartes's dualism: there's mind and then there's body; they're separate and they interact.”</p><p id="p3975">Wallace says one could try to combine dualism and panpsychism with respect to the relationship between consciousness and quantum mechanics, “but I don't think they'd combine all that well,” he said. “If consciousness is everywhere and consciousness collapses the wave function, then the wave function would be constantly collapsing and we know that doesn't happen because you get interference effects in double slit experiments.

He envisions matter and mind as intertwined. He worked with Karl Pribram to develop “Holonomic Brain Theory” (9.4.5). He explored the essence of thought with Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. Of particular import is what he calls “undivided wholeness,” meaning that the subject actively participates with the object, rather than being a detached observer. Bohm developed his “wholeness” as innately dynamic, alive, and open-ended (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib311" name="bbib311" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib311"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomez-Marin, 2023a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p3990">According to Bohm, everything is in a state of process or becoming (folding and unfolding)—Bohm calls it the "universal flux".

This means that “one must retain both the possibility that the ion activates the trigger, and exocytosis occurs, and also the possibility that the ion misses the trigger site, and exocytosis does not occur” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib726" name="bbib726" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib726"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stapp, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4075">As Beck and Eccles hypothesize, “the mental intention (the volition) becomes neurally effective by momentarily increasing the probability of exocytosis in selected cortical areas” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib39" name="bbib39" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib39"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Beck and Eccles, 1992</span></span></a>).

His common theme has been that of a relational “hidden variables” theory: a realist description of precisely what goes on in each individual event or process, which reduces to quantum mechanics in a certain limit and averaging procedure.</p><p id="p4120">In Smolin's theory, the first key idea is that “the universe is constructed from nothing but a collection of views of events, where the view of an event is what can be known about that event's place in the universe from what can be seen from that event.” In other words, “the beables of this theory [‘beable’ is short for ‘maybe-able,’ i.e., anything that could possibly be, in any superimposed quantum states] are views from events, the information available at each event from its causal past, such as its causal predecessors and the energy and momentum they transfer to the event."

That is, an elementary unit of consciousness is not a single qualia, but the entire of a partial view of the universe, as seen from one event” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib719" name="bbib719" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib719"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Smolin, 2020</span></span></a>.)</p><p id="p4125">Smolin's second key idea restricts the views that are associated with consciousness to within a very small set. Most events and their views are common and routine, he says, in that they have many near copies in the universe within their causal pasts. He proposes that these common and routine views have no conscious perceptions. Then, “there are a few, very rare views which are unprecedented, which are having their first instance, or are unique, in that they have no copies in universal history.” Smolin proposes it is “those few views of events, which are unprecedented, and/or unique, and are hence novel, [i.e., they are not duplicates of the view of any event in the event's own causal past] which are the physical correlates of conscious perceptions.”</p><p id="p4130">This addresses, he says, “the problem of why consciousness always involves awareness of a bundled grouping of qualia that define a momentary self. This gives a restricted form of panpsychism defined by a physically based selection principle which selects which views have experiential aspects.”</p><p id="p4135">To summarize, Smolin bases his theory on two concepts: First, the beables of a relational theory to be the views of events. Second, the possibility of making a physical distinction between common and routine states, on the one hand, and novel and unique states, on the other. “A relational theory that incorporates both ideas offers a possible setting for bringing qualia and consciousness into physics. The physical correlates of consciousness would be the novel or unique views of events” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib719" name="bbib719" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib719"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Smolin, 2020</span></span></a>.)</p></section><section id="sec11.10"><h3 id="sectitle0685" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">11.10.

So, when you see the world through your eyes and hear it through your ears, the brain is limiting your experience—which, on the face of it, might seem a completely bizarre thing to say, but that, at least, is an alternative view, that consciousness is not actually generated by the brain, but merely encounters the world through the brain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib113" name="bbib113" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib113"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carr, 2016c</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4155">“The only way I can see this,” Carr poses, is a state of affairs “where consciousness is primary, a fundamental aspect of reality.

They come together. Which is primary? I'm not sure the question even makes sense, because I prefer a picture in which matter and mind co-exist right from the beginning.” Carr is careful to clarify what he means by “mind.” He says, “When I use the word ‘mind’ in this context, I'm using ‘Mind’ with an upper-case ‘M’, rather than mind with a lower-case ‘m’, which is generated by the brain. ‘Mind’ with a big ‘M’ is like consciousness with a big ‘C’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib113" name="bbib113" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib113"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carr, 2016c</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4165">In forming his theory, Carr sees support from psi or the paranormal. While he recognizes that psi “encompasses a multitude of sins,” there are some aspects, such as telepathy and clairvoyance, which he takes seriously, whereas other aspects, such as precognition and psychokinesis, less so. Still, he regards even these psi phenomena as possible because of potential deep interactions between consciousness and physics. Thus, psi is another reason why, he says, “We need a theory of physics that accommodates consciousness.” (Carr stresses that he gives no credence to many aspects of psi or the paranormal.)

Now, that's probably the view which is currently the most popular among parapsychologists.” However, that's not Carr's own view. “As noted, my own favorite view is that there is this bigger space, this mental space, that in some sense links minds and perhaps matter as well.”</p><p id="p4180">Carr discerns the relationship between quantum theory and this mental space. “If you want consciousness to come into physics, quantum theory is going to play a role. All I'm saying is I don't think that quantum theory alone can explain all the phenomena. You need some form of mental space to accommodate these psi or paranormal phenomena (if you believe in these phenomena, of course, which most of my colleagues do not).” Carr stresses, rightly I think, that psi or paranormal phenomena are worth taking seriously (17), because even with a minimalist view that the probability of these phenomena being real is small, their significance for a final theory of physics would be huge” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib114" name="bbib114" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib114"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Carr, 2016d</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec11.11"><h3 id="sectitle0690" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">11.11. Faggin's quantum information-based panpsychism</h3><p id="p4185">Physicist/inventor Federico Faggin postulates “with high confidence” that “consciousness and free will are properties of quantum systems in pure quantum states” because they depend on quantum entanglement, a nonlocal property that cannot exist in any classical, deterministic universe (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib243" name="bbib243" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib243"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Faggin, 2023</span></span></a>). The kind of information involved in consciousness needs to be quantum for multiple reasons, he says, “including its intrinsic privacy and its power of building up thoughts by entangling qualia states.” As a result, Faggin comes to a “quantum-information-based panpsychism” (QIP) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib222" name="bbib222" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib222"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">D'Ariano and Faggin, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4190">The essence of QIP is that “a quantum system that is in a pure quantum state is conscious of its own state, that is, it has a qualia experience of its state.” Faggin calls this “a highly plausible postulate” because “a qualia experience is definite (integrated, not made of a mixture of separable parts) and private since it can only be known by the experiencer.”</p><p id="p4195">More formally, the theory says that a quantum state is an effective mathematical representation of a conscious experience because it possesses the same crucial characteristics of what it represents: the definiteness and privacy of the experience. “Within QIP, quantum information describes the subjective inner reality of quantum systems, a reality that is private for each system” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib243" name="bbib243" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib243"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Faggin, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4200">But this mathematical description of an experience (a vector in Hilbert space), Faggin stresses, is <em>not</em> the experience itself.

This is made possible by treating time consciousness, i.e., “consciousness-in-the-moment,” on a nonlinear temporal scale and implicitly grounding space to the contingency of changing boundary conditions. The approach is based on the <em>dynamics of functional relations</em> (not to be confused with functionalist or relational theories of consciousness). It is a nonspatial topological framework (not the mathematical study of “space” in a general sense of topological spaces) associated with the temporal aspect of the functionality. Here, functionality refers to the biological realization of the physical as those features of usefulness that exist subjectively.

Consciousness isn't individual, he says. “Instead, it is a vast field that individuals share in. This field encompasses myriad possibilities. It is the source from which thoughts, sensations, images, and feelings emerge and then dissolve back into, just as subatomic particles do in the quantum field. Mental experiences and quanta are transient, shaped by uncertainty, and are, in essence, energetic fluctuations within the consciousness field.” Chopra points to the infinite nature of the quantum and the consciousness fields, and to the essential entanglement within each, such that local realism—i.e., the world of isolated physical objects and mental thoughts—is “out the window” for both physical and mental phenomena. This entanglement, he says, “suggests that physical objects are intertwined with perception and consciousness, blurring the boundaries between the observer and the observed.” Chopra proposes “a drastic paradigm shift” in which “consciousness comes first, being the field that is the origin of creation, acting in concert with the quantum field” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib147" name="bbib147" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib147"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chopra, 2023a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib148" name="bbib148" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib148"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chopra, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4305">Philosopher Emmanuel Ransford proposes “quantum panpsychism” where matter is richer “with an extra content or dimension”—he calls it “holomatter,” composed of “holoparticles”—and consciousness is “a nonmaterial content of the world.” It assumes two types of causality: “out-causation,” causation from outside, out of reach and deterministic; and “in-causation,” causation from within, unpredictable and “self-willed,” a kind of randomness. Holoparticles, Ransford offers, also have two parts: one obvious, deterministic and out-causal; the other hidden, random-looking and in-causal. This hints, he says, that “the randomness of some quantum events is a smoking-gun evidence of in-causation.” He adds the “im-im hypothesis,” where “im-im” stands for <em>im</em>material and <em>im</em>manent, and his claimed insight is that the brain is a catalyst of the mind. “It is a biological ‘lamp’ of sorts that pours out untold sparks of consciousness instead of untold sparks of light (or photons) in the case of ordinary lamps.” Indeed, the brain spawning large flows of active and entangled in-causal holoparticles within the im-im framework would underpin ordinary consciousness—holoparticles linking quantum and consciousness.

IIT is grounded in experience, the phenomenology of consciousness, and it features mathematical description, quantitative measurement, scientific testability, broad applications, and nonpareil, intrinsic, cause-effect “structures.” In other words, “IIT addresses the problem of consciousness starting from phenomenology—the existence of my own experience, which is immediate and indubitable—rather than from the behavioral, functional, or neural correlates of experience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib797" name="bbib797" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib797"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tononi et al., 2022</span></span></a>).

First, introspection and reason identify the essential properties of consciousness—the axioms of phenomenal existence. Then, each axiom is accounted for terms of cause–effect power; that is, “translating” a “phenomenal property into an essential property of the physical substrate of consciousness” [PSC]—yielding the postulates of physical existence. In this way, IIT claims to “obtain a set of criteria that a physical substrate of consciousness (say, a set of cortical neurons) must satisfy” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib797" name="bbib797" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib797"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tononi et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4350">IIT asserts that distinct conscious experiences <em>are</em> in a literal sense distinct kinds of conceptual structures in a radical and heretofore unknown kind of “qualia space.” IIT says (and introduced the idea) that for every conscious experience, there is a corresponding mathematical object such that the mathematical features of that object are isomorphic to the properties of the experience.</p><p id="p4355">“Integrated information theory means that you need a very special kind of mechanism organized in a special kind of way to experience consciousness,” Tononi says. “A conscious experience is a maximally reduced conceptual structure in a space called ‘qualia space.’ Think of it as a shape. But not an ordinary shape—a shape seen from the inside.” Tononi stresses that simulation is “not the real thing.” To be truly conscious, he said, an entity must be “of a certain kind that can constrain its past and future—and certainly a simulation is not of that kind” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib794" name="bbib794" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib794"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tononi, 2014b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4360">Christof Koch envisions how IIT could explain experience—how consciousness arises out of matter. “The theory makes two fundamental axiomatic assumptions,” Koch explains. “First, conscious experiences are unique and there are a vast number of different conscious experiences. Just think of all the frames of all the movies you've ever seen or movies that will ever be made until the end of time. Each one is a unique visual experience and you can couple that with all the unique auditory experiences, pain experiences, etc. All possible conscious experiences are a gigantic number. Second, at the same time, each experience is integrated—what philosophers refer to as unitary. Whatever I am conscious of, I am conscious of as a whole. I apprehend as a whole. So, the idea is to take these two axioms seriously and to cast them into an information theory framework. Why information theory? Because information theory deals with different states and their interrelationships. We don't think the stuff the brain is made out of is really what's critical about consciousness. It's the interrelationship that's critical” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib454" name="bbib454" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib454"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Koch, 2012b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4365">IIT starts from phenomenology itself—a point that Tononi stresses cannot be overstressed—with axioms that are deemed to be unequivocally and universally true for all instances of consciousness, such that whatever systems manifest these axioms will ipso facto manifest consciousness.</p><p id="p4370">It is at this point that IIT seeks a mathematical expression of the fundamental properties of experience.

By contrast, if something has cause–effect power but does not qualify as an intrinsic entity, it can only be said to exist extrinsically—to exist for something else—say, for an external observer—in a relative sense. And intrinsic, absolute existence is the only existence worth having—what we might call true existence. Said otherwise, an intrinsic entity is the only entity worth being.”</p><p id="p4440">In a crucial move, according to Tononi and colleagues, “IIT asserts an <em>explanatory identity</em>: an experience is identical to a Φ-structure. In other words, the phenomenal properties of an experience—its quality or how it feels—correspond one-to-one to the physical properties of the cause–effect structure unfolded from the physical substrate of consciousness. Thus, all the contents of an experience here and now—including spatial extendedness; temporal flow; objects; colors and sounds; thoughts, intentions, decisions, and beliefs; doubts and convictions; hopes and fears; memories and expectations—correspond to sub-structures in a cause–effect structure (Ф-folds in a Ф-structure)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib797" name="bbib797" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib797"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tononi et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4445">This means that “all contents of experience correspond to sub-structures within a maximally irreducible cause–effect structure—to Φ-folds within a Φ-structure.

Moreover, what actually exists is only the Ф-structure corresponding to my experience, not also an associated physical substrate.

Everywhere there is energy-matter, perhaps everywhere there is even spacetime, panpsychism says there is also something of consciousness.

He states that assuming fine-tuning needs explanation (it is not “an implausible fluke”), then there are three prime categories to evaluate: theism, multiverse, and “agent cosmopsychism.” He argues that “agentive cosmopsychism is more theoretically virtuous than theism” because “God” would require “a commitment to both physical and non-physical kinds, and to both necessary and contingent kinds.” Similarly, on the multiverse, he argues that “its structural complexity is realized by an astronomical number of distinct individuals” that “we cannot directly observe,” whereas on agentive cosmopsychism, “the structural complexity is realized by the properties of a single individual,” so there is no need to “postulate a single new individual.” Goff reasons that agentive cosmopsychism is more parsimonious in that it requires “only one causal capacity rather than multiple” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib297" name="bbib297" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib297"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Goff, 2019a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib298" name="bbib298" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib298"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Goff, 2019b</span></span></a>).

He claims that using a top-down approach (with which he derives polytheism from pantheism) in conjunction with endorsing cosmopsychism, “the consciousness of the cosmos is ontologically prior to the consciousnesses of individuals like us.” This, he says, avoids the combination problem (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib569" name="bbib569" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib569"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Nagasawa, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4660">Sophisticated arguments for cosmopsychism come from Indian philosophy.

It's about choosing among possibilities.” What then does consciousness do?” he asks. “It enables different possibilities to be held together and chosen among”—yielding his non-mainstream postulate that “any system in nature that has possibilities that are not fixed would have some measure of consciousness.” A key to Sheldrake's consciousness is how “physical reality at any moment opens up into the future through a range of possibilities … And it's those future possibilities which are the realm in which consciousness operates.” All things that have consciousness are in this same state (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib703" name="bbib703" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib703"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sheldrake, 2007b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4810">Referencing the indeterminate nature of quantum mechanics, Sheldrake says, “even a hydrogen atom and an electron has a whole realm of possibility open to it, of which only a small fraction is realized … [but] to what extent it's making real choices, to what extent consciousness [occurs] in something as simple as an electron, is arguable and probably undecidable.”</p><p id="p4815">He then makes his even more startling move: “I think it gets much more interesting when we look at larger systems like the sun or the galaxy.” Here's Sheldrake's argument: “If consciousness emerges from patterns of electrical activity in our brains, as materialists would assume, the sun has vastly more complex patterns of electrical activity than our brains. So why shouldn't that be associated with consciousness? Why shouldn't the sun have a mind? And if the sun has a mind, why not all the stars?

Wallace's panpsychism inside physics</h3><p id="p4845">To philosopher of physics David Wallace, one way to motivate panpsychism is as a kind of synthesis of materialism (consciousness is just reducible to the physical) and dualism (consciousness is separate from the physical). Each, he says, has major advantages and major disadvantages. “Materialism seems like it can't adequately explain consciousness. Dualism can't give an adequate causal role to consciousness.” Wallace envisions panpsychism “as a way of getting the best features of both materialism and dualism without their disadvantages,” which is why he envisions “panpsychism potentially as the synthesis of materialism and dualism” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib823" name="bbib823" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib823"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wallace, 2016a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4850">Wallace starts with dualism, where “consciousness is real and fundamental, existing at the bottom-most level of nature”—but dualism, he stresses, has a serious problem: “How can dualism play a causal role in physics, because physics looks to be closed and autonomous?” This is where Wallace has panpsychism playing the critical causal role by looking to the intrinsic nature of physics. “Physics tells us how fields and particles relate to each other, but it doesn't tell us about what they really are in themselves. According to panpsychism, consciousness is right there inside the physical world, as its intrinsic nature, and thus when one field or particle affects another, it's really consciousness which is doing the causing. So, you get a causal role for consciousness in physics and you get consciousness as real and fundamental.” That's a set of advantages, Wallace argues, “that no other theory has—and it motivates panpsychism” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib823" name="bbib823" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib823"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wallace, 2016a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4855">Wallace explains that when physics gives a mathematical theory of how all fundamental physical entities relate to one another quantitatively, it doesn't tell us what these entities actually are. This gives room, he says, for panpsychism to offer a hypothesis about what these entities actually are. However, Wallace stresses that the intrinsic relationship among all these entities, non-conscious and conscious, must be as described by the laws of physics. There is no need to postulate a fifth kind of force or feature as the carrier of panpsychic consciousness, he says; rather, the need is, as Stephen Hawking put it, “What is it that breathes fire into the equations?” That would be the fundamental nature of the reality that physics is describing (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib823" name="bbib823" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib823"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wallace, 2016a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib824" name="bbib824" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib824"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2016b</span></span></a>).

Whitehead's process theory</h3><p id="p4860">Although Process Theory is already classified under Materialism Theories/Relational, motivated by Griffin's “panexperiential physicalism” (9.7.7), I am making the odd decision to classify it also here under Panpsychism, motivated by process philosopher Matthew Segall's bringing Alfred North Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism “into conversation with the recent panpsychist turn in analytic philosophy of mind.” According to Segall, “Whitehead's unabashedly metaphysical project broadly aligns with recent critiques of reductive physicalism and the turn toward a conception of experience as basic to Nature.” Whitehead's panexperientialism, he says, attempts to take consciousness at face value, resisting inflationary accounts toward absolute idealism and deflationary toward eliminative materialism (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib693" name="bbib693" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib693"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Segall, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4865">Segall distinguishes Whitehead's process-relational panexperientialism from the dominant substance-property variants of panpsychism, arguing that Whitehead's version avoids many of panpsychism's conceptual difficulties. To begin, “Whitehead's process-relational rendering doesn't claim that experience is a ‘primary attribute’ or ‘intrinsic property’ of matter. This is because in Whitehead's view, physics has moved beyond the substantialist view of matter, and talk of essential or accidental properties only made sense given such an [archaic] ontology … While there was an ‘essential distinction between [substantial] matter at an instant and the agitations of experience,’ with this conception of matter having been swept away, a door is opened to analogies between energetic activity and concrete experience.” Thus, “Experiences, like energy vectors, are intrinsically process-relational in that they always involve transition beyond themselves: They manifest in a ‘specious present’ [Whitehead] as a tension between the actualized facts of an inherited past and the potential forms of an anticipated future” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib693" name="bbib693" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib693"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Segall, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4870">While Segall has “the philosophical payoff of panpsychism” dissolving the hard problem of consciousness by “giving experience its proper place in Nature without undermining the scientific image of the universe.” Regarding substance-property panpsychism's combination problem, Segall says that Whitehead's process-relational approach “doesn't so much solve this problem as it does reframe the problem's presuppositions.” Whitehead does this not by “struggling to understand how abstract little bits of extended matter with mental intrinsic properties might combine to form bigger bits of minded matter,” but rather by starting “with a more concrete conception of energetic activity that is more easily analogized to agitations of experience. Neither ‘matter’ nor ‘mind’ is composed of simply located bits or states.” Thus, “the ongoing composition of the cosmos is achieved not through the summation of tiny parts, nor through subtraction from some larger whole (as cosmopsychists would have it), but by a dipolar relational process with both a stability providing material pole and a novelty inducing mental pole.”</p><p id="p4875">According to Segall, “Whitehead is neither a micropsychist nor a cosmopsychist exclusively. He tries to have it both ways. There is a universal soul, a psyche of the cosmos, a primordial actuality or God of this world, and there are countless creatures creating in concert with it. Creativity transcends both God and finite actualities; it is the source of all co-evolving parts, wholes, bodies, and souls. Whitehead's account of process includes moments of combination and decombination, conjunction and disjunction. For Whitehead the combination problem becomes a logic of concrescence [i.e., ‘the production of novel togetherness’], a feature and not a bug, a way of thinking change as more than just the rearrangement of pre-existing parts or the fragmentation of a pre-existing whole but as <em>genuine becoming</em>, as an ‘emergent evolution’ or ‘creative advance’ where neither wholes nor parts pre-exist their relations … and in each act of creation the past is not destroyed but re-incarnated in the novel occasion … Concrescence is thus a cumulative process and not a merely additive one” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib693" name="bbib693" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib693"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Segall, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4880">Some call Whitehead's defense of a panpsychist philosophy the theory's most significant development in the 20th century. Whitehead radically reforms “our conception of the fundamental nature of the world, placing <em>events</em> (or items that are more event-like than thing-like) and the ongoing <em>processes</em> of their creation and extinction as the core feature of the world, rather than the traditional triad of matter, space and time. His panpsychism arises from the idea that the elementary events that make up the world (which he called <em>occasions</em>) partake of mentality in some—often extremely attenuated—sense, metaphorically expressed in terms of the mentalistic notions of creativity, spontaneity and perception” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib302" name="bbib302" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib302"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Goff et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4885">This makes Whitehead an emergentist rather than a constitutive panpsychist. “A given moment of conscious experience is not reducible to nor simply identical with its constituent parts.” It is “a creative repetition of the past rather than a combination of parts” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib693" name="bbib693" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib693"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Segall, 2020</span></span></a>).</p></section></section><section id="sec14"><h2 id="sectitle0800" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">14.

Because monisms seek to account for both mental and physical aspects of reality, avoiding the metaphysical difficulties of dualism and overcoming the explanatory weakness of materialism, it follows that monisms are also theories of consciousness.

Both are motivated by the need to integrate consciousness into the deep nature of reality; thus, monism theories have panpsychism features and panpsychism theories can be seen as monisms (to first approximations). Perhaps it is simply the case of each reinforcing the other in what are merely different perspectives, historical and theoretically, on essentially the same stance regarding the fundamental nature of ultimate reality. However, they are not entirely the same in that panpsychism has phenomenal or protophenomenal properties as a part or aspect of some larger, fundamental entity, while monism has only one fundamental entity that encompasses everything (although it is not intuitively obvious that this distinction makes much of a difference). Separate categories for monism and panpsychism are certainly justified, yet the boundary can be fuzzy.</p><p id="p4900">Some of the theories or ways of thinking that follow are categorized under Monism because all other categories seem less appropriate, imposing a belief system that should not apply.

The claim is that the conundrum of consciousness, and how it fits into the physical world, is so critical that integrating consciousness (or proto-consciousness) into fundamental reality could suggest that the elements integrated are distinct from the ones revealed as a result of integration, thus shadowing if not revealing hidden, deep, intrinsic features of the physical world (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib302" name="bbib302" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib302"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Goff et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4910">Three core concepts conjoin to generate Russellian monism: (i) <em>structuralism about physics</em> (describing the world in terms of its spatiotemporal/relational structure and dynamics); (ii) <em>realism about quiddities</em> (or <em>inscrutables</em>) (there are <em>quiddities/inscrutables</em>, which underlie but are not limited by the structure and dynamics physics describes); and (iii) <em>quidditism</em> (or “<em>inscrutinism”) about consciousness</em> (at least some <em>quiddities/inscrutables</em> are either phenomenal or protophenomenal properties and are thereby relevant to the essence of consciousness) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib8" name="bbib8" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib8"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Alter and Nagasawa, 2012</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib9" name="bbib9" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib9"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Alter and Pereboom, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4915">Daniel Stoljar presents four different accounts of the inscrutables: “(i) Phenomenal monism: The inscrutables are phenomenal in nature.

Davidson's anomalous monism</h3><p id="p4930">Anomalous Monism, developed by philosopher Donald Davidson, holds that mental properties and events must have a physical ontology, but that psychology cannot be reduced to physics. As such, Anomalous Monism is a form of property dualism (15.1) and shares features with Non-reductive Physicalism (10). As Davidson writes, “anomalous monism holds that mental entities (particular time- and space-bound objects and events) are physical entities, but that mental concepts are not reducible by definition or natural law to physical concepts” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib185" name="bbib185" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib185"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Davidson, 1993</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4935">Anomalous Monism is distinguished from other theories of consciousness by the intersection of three propositional claims: (i) Mental events have genuine causal powers and cause physical events. (ii) All causal relationships are backed by natural laws. (iii) There are no natural laws connecting mental phenomena with physical phenomena. While each claim has adherents, it is the conjunction of the three claims, taken together, that gives Anomalous Monism its distinctive look, because at first glance there surely appears to be inconsistency (if not contradiction) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib709" name="bbib709" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib709"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Silcox, n.d.</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4940">To appreciate Anomalous Monism's originality and subtleties, it needs to be unpacked. A foundational principle is that “psychology cannot be a science like basic physics, in that it cannot in principle yield exceptionless laws for predicting or explaining human thoughts and actions (mental anomalism).” And it is “precisely because there can be no such strict laws governing mental events that those events must be identical to physical events” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib843" name="bbib843" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib843"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Yalowitz, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4945">How to make sense of this? What may seem like a non sequitur is in fact the heart of the argument. If the physical is the only existent, then ipso facto the mental (like everything else) must come from the physical with robust regularities. But how do the mental and physical articulate? What is this connection?</p><p id="p4950">Here's the flow of the argument. Given that the mental has causal powers (claim 1), and that all causal relationships require natural law (claim 2), because there are no natural (psychophysical) laws that connect the mental and the physical (claim 3), therefore there is only one logical way to connect mental events and physical events—now denied a causal relationship (combining claims 2 and 3): they must be literally <em>the same thing</em>, the mental and the physical must be in the strong sense <em>identical</em>.</p><p id="p4955">As identity theories of consciousness are a leitmotif, and a touchstone, for comprehending the Landscape, we go deeper. Earlier identity theories held that “claims concerning the identity of particular mental and physical events (tokens) depended upon the discovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical properties (types) … Token-identity claims thus depended upon type-identity.”</p><p id="p4960">But Anomalous Monism, almost by its founding premise, does not depend on such psychophysical laws. “Davidson's position is dramatically different … It in effect justifies the token-identity of mental and physical events through arguing for the impossibility of type-identities between mental and physical properties” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib843" name="bbib843" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib843"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Yalowitz, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4965">Now of course this argument proves that the mental and the physical are identical only to the extent that the three premises are all accepted as valid, because the conclusion is embedded (or “hidden”) within the premises (as are all deductive arguments structured in this way). Anomalous Monism differs from other theories especially in claiming that there are no natural laws connecting mental phenomena with physical phenomena. Other theories assume there are laws or ways to connect the mental and the physical, or laws or ways where the mental and the physical are part of, or derived from, the same stuff.</p></section><section id="sec14.3"><h3 id="sectitle0815" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">14.3. Velmans's reflexive monism</h3><p id="p4970">Psychologist Max Velmans describes Reflexive monism as “a dual-aspect theory” (in the tradition of Spinoza) which argues that the one basic stuff of which the universe is composed has the potential to manifest both in physical forms and as conscious experience. According to the theory, in the universe's “evolution from some primal undifferentiated state,” it differentiates into “distinguishable physical entities, at least some of which have the potential for conscious experience, such as human beings” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib818" name="bbib818" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib818"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Velmans, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4975">Velmans's “Monism” is straightforward: “the view that the universe, at the deepest level of analysis, is one thing, or composed of one fundamental kind of stuff.” His “Reflexive” is more complex: “Each human participates in a process whereby the universe differentiates into parts and becomes conscious in manifold ways of itself, making the entire process reflexive.”</p><p id="p4980">Velmans focuses on “the ontological status and seeming ‘out-thereness’ of the phenomenal world and to how the ‘phenomenal world’ relates to the ‘physical world’, the ‘world itself’, and processing in the brain.” He seeks both to bridge the materialist-dualist gap and to differentiate Reflexive Monism from “both dualism and variants of physicalist and functionalist reductionism, focusing on those aspects of the theory that challenge deeply rooted presuppositions in current Western thought.” Within Reflexive Monism, he says, “the brain is simply what the human mind looks like when it is viewed from an external (third-person) perspective, and neither the observations of external observers nor those of subjects have a privileged status” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib818" name="bbib818" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib818"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Velmans, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4985">Central to Velmans's argument is that in terms of their phenomenology, “experiences of the external world are none other than the physical world-as-experienced, thereby placing aspects of human consciousness in the external phenomenal world, rather than exclusively within the head or brain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib819" name="bbib819" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib819"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Velmans, 2023</span></span></a>)<em>.</em> His reflexive model also makes the strong claim—the radical claim—that, “Insofar as experiences are anywhere, <em>they are roughly where they seem to be</em>.” For example, “A pain in the foot is in the experienced foot, and this perceived print on this visible page really is out here on this visible page. Nor is a pain in the foot accompanied by some other, <em>additional</em> experience of pain in the brain, or is this perceived print accompanied by some additional experience of print in the brain. In terms of phenomenology, this perceived print, and my experience of this print are <em>one and the same</em>.” Technically, he says, this is a form of <em>phenomenological externalism</em> (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib818" name="bbib818" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib818"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Velmans, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4990">To understand how experienced objects and events might really be (roughly) where they are experienced to be, Velmans looks closely at “the way that phenomenal space relates to ‘real’ space. No one doubts that physical bodies can have real extension and location in space.” But we “find it hard to accept that experiences can have a real, as opposed to a ‘seeming’ location and extension.” We do not doubt, he says, that a physical foot has a real location and extension in space, but a pain in the foot can't really be in the foot, as we are “committed to the view that it is either nowhere or in the brain.” Although this common understanding that “location in phenomenal space is not location in real space,” according to Reflexive Monism, “this ignores the fact that, in everyday life, we take the phenomenal world to be the physical world. It also ignores the pivotal role of phenomenal space in forming our very understanding of space, and with it, our understanding of location and extension in measured or ‘real’ space” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib818" name="bbib818" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib818"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Velmans, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p4995">Velmans says that Reflexive Monism provides a different perspective on the hard problem of consciousness by viewing physical and experiential aspects of mind as arising from a common “psychophysical ground.” Thus, he argues, of the competing views of consciousness on offer, Reflexive Monism, being a non-reductionist dual-aspect theory, “most closely follows the contours of ordinary experience, the findings of science, and common sense” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib818" name="bbib818" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib818"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Velmans, 2008</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec14.4"><h3 id="sectitle0820" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">14.4.

It is, he says, ironic that these two words have “been used to name a position in the philosophy of mind that directly rejects the heart of materialism and is certainly false” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib741" name="bbib741" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib741"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Strawson, 2011</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5010">Strawson asserts that physicalism (or materialism<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn47" name="bfn47" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn47"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>47</sup></span></span></a>), that is, “real physicalism” (or “real materialism”), entails panexperientialism or panpsychism, on one assumption: it entails panpsychism given the impossibility of “radical” emergence.

But then comes the “Strawsonian Twist.”</p><p id="p5025">What does it take to be a “realistic physicalist” or a “real physicalist?” He makes one thing absolutely clear. “You're certainly not a realistic physicalist, you're not a real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience, ‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-it's-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it and know it at almost every waking moment.”</p><p id="p5030">All materialists hold that every concrete phenomenon in the universe is physical, and they are neither sensible nor realistic, Strawson says, if they have any inclination to deny the concrete reality of mental phenomena like experiential phenomena. He concludes by taking no prisoners: “Full recognition of the reality of experience, then, is the obligatory starting point for any remotely realistic version of physicalism … It is the obligatory starting point for any theory that can legitimately claim to be ‘naturalistic’ because experience is itself the fundamental given natural fact” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib739" name="bbib739" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib739"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Strawson, 2008</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5035">As a “real physicalist,” in his definition, Strawson holds that the mental/experiential is physical, and he is happy to say, along with many other physicalists, that experience is ‘really just neurons firing’, at least in the case of biological organisms like ourselves. But when he says these words he means something radically different from what almost all physicalists mean. He does not mean that all characteristics of what is going on, in the case of experience, can be described by physics and neurophysiology (or any non-revolutionary extensions of them). His claim is stunningly different. It's that experiential phenomena “just are” physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and neurophysiology account for (or <em>can</em> account for).

Polkinghorne's dual-aspect monism</h3><p id="p5045">To mathematical physicist and Anglican priest John Polkinghorne, the psychosomatic nature of human persons is best understood in terms of a “dual-aspect monism,” in which matter and mind are complementary aspects of a unitary being (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib620" name="bbib620" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib620"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2009</span></span></a>). He is sure that we're not simply matter, that reality is more than just ideas, and that none of the classical solutions seem to correspond to our experience.</p><p id="p5055">In fact, Polkinghorne argues that classical materialism, idealism and Cartesian dualism all exhibit a bankruptcy in the face of the many-layered, and yet interconnected, character of our encounter with reality. This recognition encourages the search for some form of dual-aspect monism—similar theories are called “double-aspect theories”—an account that would acknowledge the fundamental distinction between experience of the material and experience of the mental but which would neither impose on reality a sharp division into two unconnected kinds of substance nor deny the psychosomatic unity of human beings (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib617" name="bbib617" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib617"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2001</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5060">Dual-aspect monism is designed to take seriously both our mental experiences and the material world. It claims that they are related in a very deep and complementary way in that there is only one stuff in the world. Dual-aspect monism seeks to avoid devaluing or subordinating either side. Polkinghorne rejects the charge that dual-aspect monism is a subtle form of materialism, because, he says, “It doesn't treat the mental as being just an epiphenomenon of the material” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib347" name="bbib347" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib347"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Harris, 1998</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5065">To give physical systems the kind of freedom and top-down control that he desires, Polkinghorne recruits complexity theory, with its dualities of parts/whole and energy/information. The intrinsic unpredictabilities present in nature, he states, afford the metaphysical opportunity to consider dissipative systems as exhibiting top–down causality (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib620" name="bbib620" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib620"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2009</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5070">Given that in dual-aspect monism there cannot be a nonphysical soul, much less an immortal soul, how does Polkinghorne account for the eschatological requirements of his strong Christian faith, especially the biblical resurrection of the dead? How might resurrecting the body and reconstituting the “soul” work?</p><p id="p5075">Speaking on <em>Closer To Truth</em>, Polkinghorne asks, "Can you make credible understanding of a destiny beyond death for human beings?" From his theological perspective, he sets two equal and opposite requirements for the afterlife of a soul: continuity, in that the same person must live after death, and discontinuity, in that the afterlife-person must live on forever (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib619" name="bbib619" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib619"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5080">“There is not much point in making Abraham, Isaac and Jacob alive again if they are going to die again,” he says. “So, you must have both continuity and discontinuity. Now when you think about the continuity side, what could make those people the same as the ones who lived on earth before? The traditional answer has been the soul, often understood in platonic terms—there is some sort of spiritual bit of us liberated at death that exists and carries on.”</p><p id="p5085">Polkinghorne has none of that. “I think that's a mistake,” he says. “We are animated bodies, not animated souls. We're not apprentice angels; we are embodied human beings. But if we've lost our ‘spiritual soul’ [as a resource], have we lost our continuity? I don't think so, but we have to reconceive the soul.”</p><p id="p5090">Polkinghorne focuses on the carrier of continuity for a person in this life. “It's quite difficult,” he says; “here am I, an aging, balding academic—what makes me the same person as that little boy with the shock of black hair in the school photograph of many years ago? It's not atomic-material continuity: the atoms in my body are totally different than the atoms in that schoolboy's body.”</p><p id="p5095">“It cannot be the atoms,” he continues, “but it is the pattern of how some of those atoms are organized, in some extraordinary, elaborate, and complex way.” That, Polkinghorne states, is “what I think the human soul is. The soul is the information-bearing pattern; that's the real me” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib619" name="bbib619" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib619"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5100">Thus, Polkinghorne reconceives the “soul” as an information-bearing pattern that is encoded by and carried in the body/brain, and which is dissolved at death along with the dissolution of the body. However, this unique pattern, this real me, is retained in the divine memory for re-embodiment at the resurrection of the dead (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib618" name="bbib618" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib618"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2003</span></span></a>).

The discontinuity side, Polkinghorne says, “is that I'm not made alive again in order to die again, so while I'm going to be embodied, I must be embodied in some new form of matter. And it is perfectly coherent to believe that God can bring into being such a new form of matter” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib619" name="bbib619" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib619"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Polkinghorne, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5115">To Richard Swinburne, the idea of afterlife existence germinating from a renewed instantiation of the pattern of information that we had when living on Earth is problematic. "The trouble is not merely how could God, if God so chose, bring into [renewed] existence a being with a specific pattern of information, but rather that God could [therefore] bring into existence a few thousand such beings. But because only one of them could be me, a pattern of information provides no additional criterion for distinguishing which one that would be. And whatever the extra criterion is, it would have to be such that there [logically] could only be one instance of it at one time. And if we have such a criterion, then what need is there for the pattern of information to be the same as a previous pattern?"

Teilhard de Cardin's evolving consciousness</h3><p id="p5120">The Jesuit philosopher/theologian and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin envisioned the evolution of consciousness as axial in a grand cosmic system of continuing complexification where consciousness becomes planetized and even “God” is an emergent in a process of “theogenesis” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib198" name="bbib198" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib198"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Delio, 2020</span></span></a>).

God evolves the universe and brings it to its completion through the human person.” Now the computer, according to Teilhard, “has evoked a new level of shared consciousness, a level of cybernetic mind giving rise to a field of global mind through interconnecting pathways” (foreshadowing the internet) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib199" name="bbib199" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib199"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Delio, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5130">Teilhard was a dual-aspect monist. He “considered matter and consciousness not as two substances or two different modes of existence, but as two aspects of the same cosmic stuff.” Mind and matter “are neither separate nor is one reducible to the other, and yet neither can function without the other.” From the Big Bang onward, Delio says, Teilhard has “a ‘withinness’ and ‘withoutness,’ or what he called radial energy and tangential energy. Consciousness is, in a sense, the withinness or ‘inside’ of matter, and attraction is the ‘outside’ of matter; hence, the energy of matter is both attractive (tangential) and transcendent (radial).” The complementarity of mind and matter is said “to explain both the rise of biological complexity and the corresponding rise of consciousness.” Teilhard identifies “the core energy of the universe as love, which both unifies and transcends by way of consciousness. The greater the exterior levels of physical complexity, the greater the interior levels of consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib199" name="bbib199" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib199"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Delio, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5135">To Teilhard, evolution describes “the dynamic impulse in life toward more being and consciousness” and that which drives evolution is consciousness. In short, “evolution is the rise of consciousness.” Following Julian Huxley, he writes that the human person “is nothing else than evolution become conscious of itself”—and adds, “The consciousness of each of us is evolution looking at itself and reflecting upon itself” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib777" name="bbib777" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib777"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Teilhard de Chardin, 1959</span></span></a>).

God and world are entangled with one another to the extent that talk of God is impossible apart from talk about nature and creative change, and talk of nature makes no sense apart from God” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib199" name="bbib199" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib199"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Delio, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5150">In summary, Teilhard describes “matter as the matrix of consciousness.” He posits “the law of complexity-consciousness” as a fundamental principle of evolution, and conversely, “evolution is fundamentally the rise of consciousness.” Moreover, the human person is “evolution become conscious of itself,” with the ultimate goal of “the maximization of thought” whereby consciousness radiates “throughout the whole, in every aspect of the cosmos,” and then of “self-reflective consciousness,” whereby “the human person can stand apart from the world and reflect on it” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib200" name="bbib200" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib200"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Delio, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 30–32).</p><p id="p5155">Finally, the foundation of Teilhard's paradigm is “Omega,” which he sees as the “prime mover of evolution,” the unifying power in evolution. Omega works its guiding magic from the very beginning of things, “acting on pre-living cosmic elements,” moving into consciousness as it emerged as the goal toward which evolution complexifies and converges. “Omega is the absolute whole,” making “wholeness in nature not only possible but also intensely personal.

Atmanspacher's dual-aspect monism</h3><p id="p5160">Physicist-philosopher Harald Atmanspacher presents mind and matter, mental and material domains of reality, as manifestations, or aspects, of one underlying, fundamental reality in which mind and matter are inseparable. He distinguishes between the epistemic discernment of both the separate domains and the underlying reality, and the ontic existence of the “psychophysically neutral domain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5165">He also distinguishes two classes of dual-aspect theories based on “the way in which the psychophysically neutral domain is related to the mental and the physical.” In Russellian monisms, “the <em>compositional</em> arrangements of psychophysically neutral elements decide how they differ with respect to mental or physical properties. As a consequence, the mental and the physical are reducible to the neutral domain” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5170">Whereas in <em>decompositional</em> dual-aspect theories, “the basic metaphysics of the psychophysically neutral domain is holistic, and the mental and the physical (neither reducible to one another nor to the neutral) emerge by breaking the holistic symmetry or, in other words, by making distinctions. This framework is guided by the analogy to quantum holism …. [which is] based on speculations that clearly exceed the scope of contemporary quantum theory.”</p><p id="p5175">Atmanspacher establishes connections between the ontic and epistemic domains of dual-aspect theory and David Bohm's famous notions of implicate and explicate order (11.3). “Mental and physical states emerge by explication, or unfoldment, from an ultimately undivided and psychophysically neutral implicate, enfolded order.” This order is dynamic, not static, as in Whitehead's process philosophy (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>). Atmanspacher finds dual-aspect potency in the conjecture by quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli and analytical psychologist Carl Jung on the concept of synchronicity and draws on dual-aspect elements from the two disciplines (17.2; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib212" name="bbib212" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib212"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Double-aspect theory, 2023</span></span></a>)</p><p id="p5180">In other words, Atmanspacher's dual-aspect theory hypothesizes that mental and material manifestations may inherit mutual correlations because they are jointly caused by the psychophysically neutral level. Such correlations, he says, would be “remnants reflecting the lost holism of the underlying reality” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5185">Atmanspacher and philosopher of physics Dean Rickles extend the metaphysical position of dual-aspect monism by aligning “the deep structure of meaning” as “a fundamental feature of the nature of reality,” stressing that “the decompositional version of dual-aspect monism considers the mental and the physical as two aspects of one underlying undivided reality that is psychophysically neutral.” Crediting their forerunners (Wolfgang Pauli, Carl Jung, Arthur Eddington, John Wheeler, David Bohm, and Basil Hiley), the authors “reconstruct the formal structure of these approaches, and compare their conceptual emphases as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses.” Their intent is to establish dual-aspect monism as a scientifically and philosophically robust alternative to physicalism, dualism and idealism (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib23" name="bbib23" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib23"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher and Rickles, 2022</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec14.8"><h3 id="sectitle0840" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">14.8.

Within the formalism, symmetry is said to play a significant compositional, functional, and aesthetic role. It is called the Symmetry Theory of Valence (proposed by philosopher Michael Edward Johnson): the symmetry of an information geometry of mind corresponds with how pleasant or unpleasant it is to be (or have) that experience.

If the mental merely supervened physically upon the material, in the way the shape of the wheel supervenes upon the wheel's iron molecules, it is impossible coherently to conceive of that miraculous conjugation as merely a structural extension of inherent physical propensities. Here each level operates in ways radically disparate from—even contrary to—the ways in which the other operates. Material structures and forces, if the reductionist picture of nature is correct, are composite, fragmentable, non-purposive, non-intentional, and essentially third-person; mental agency, by contrast, is indivisibly unified, physically infrangible, thoroughly teleological, inherently intentional, and irreducibly first-person (that is, conscious)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib319" name="bbib319" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib319"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hart, 2019a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib356" name="bbib356" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib356"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2022a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib359" name="bbib359" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib359"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2022d</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5270">Hart is certain that “nothing like an actual science of mental reality will ever be conceivable (much less practicable) so long as the culture of the sciences clings to a belief in the principle of the ‘causal closure of the physical’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib355" name="bbib355" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib355"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hart, 2021b</span></span></a>).

Leslie's consciousness inside an infinite mind</h3><p id="p5310">Philosopher John Leslie suggests that ethical requirements, when not overruled by stronger ethical requirements, are creatively effective. The cosmos they create is a collection of infinitely many minds, each infinite mind eternally conscious of all that's worth contemplating. Our universe is a structure inside one such mind, its reality consisting simply in its being contemplated. (Infinitely many finer universes might join our universe in that mind's consciousness, but it does at least deserve its place there.) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib496" name="bbib496" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib496"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Leslie, 2001</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5315">How, though, would one's own consciousness fit into this scenario? Well, each infinite mind is “a single existent” in this sense, that its ingredients stand to it somewhat as a ruby's shape and its redness stand to the ruby; they couldn't exist independently, any more than could the particles in the Bose-Einstein condensates described by quantum physics. But despite how all the parts of each universe which any such mind contemplated would exist—remember, solely through entering into that mind's contemplations—some of those parts could each have consciousness of its own. They could be conscious brains, or conscious computers. Being inside the existential unity of that mind wouldn't make these know that it was there that they existed, or what other things existed there. Conscious, when it contemplated us, of every quark and electron of your brain and mine, that mind could leave us in ignorance even of each other's existence (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib496" name="bbib496" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib496"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Leslie, 2001</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5320">Similarly, our lives from birth to death could be eternally present to that mind's awareness whereas we could only guess what would fill our next few hours. Still, one's consciousness might itself be existentially unified at any given moment, perhaps thanks to quantum-physical processes. This could explain how the entirety of a painting, for instance, can be known in a single glance. Brains without regions that featured quantum computations, computers which weren't quantum computers, might be incapable of such knowledge.</p><p id="p5325">Leslie concludes, “Innumerable further things worth contemplating would exist inside each infinite mind, many of them quite unlike our universe and its living beings.

Dualisms</h2><p id="p5330">Dualism is the theory of consciousness that requires two radically distinct parts: a physical brain, obviously, but also in addition, a separate, nonphysical substance that is not only independent of the brain but also not of the physical world (as presently conceived). This would mean that reality consists of (at least) two ontological categories—physical and nonphysical, whether substances, properties, aspects, dimensions or planes of existence. Dualism is often called “substance dualism,” to distinguish it from “property dualism,” which is ontologically different (15.1). In general usage, “dualism” means substance dualism.</p><p id="p5335">For dualism to be true, what follows must be that the physical world, at its most fundamental level of fields and forces, is not in some way causally closed, and that mental properties play a causal role in affecting the physical world. This perspective, often called <em>interactionism</em>, provides that physical states cause phenomenal states, and phenomenal states cause physical states, and whatever psychophysical laws there may be will operate in both directions (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib124" name="bbib124" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib124"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2003</span></span></a>; 15.8).</p><p id="p5340">Common forms of dualism identify the essence of the person with a nonphysical “soul,” generally an immortal soul. This kind of “soul-centered dualism” is also the theory of consciousness most widely believed by the vast majority of the world's population, largely implicitly via acculturation to belief systems, whether organized religion or folk traditions. Dualism (substance dualism), certainly, is the default doctrine in the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.</p><p id="p5345">Dualism is largely rejected by philosophers, at least by most professional philosophers in the West<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn48" name="bfn48" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn48"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>48</sup></span></span></a> (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib609" name="bbib609" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib609"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">PhilPapers Survey, 2009</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib610" name="bbib610" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib610"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2020</span></span></a>). Dualism has fallen out of philosophical favor for at least four reasons. (i) No Interactions: given the scientific understanding that the physical world is a causally closed system in that every event has a prior, physically efficient cause, how could anything outside such a closed system affect it?

(ii) Not Parsimonious: two kinds of world stuffs seem excessively complex; Occam's razor cuts unnecessary entities in explanations. (iii) No Knowledge: souls are slippery; how to know anything about how they work? (iv) Fading Divine Creator: With God less prominent in academia, there seems one less way to create or allocate souls.</p><p id="p5350">In trying to characterize souls (assuming for a moment that souls do exist), we ask questions. Are all souls exactly the same, as all electrons in the electron quantum field are the same? Are souls undifferentiated (everyone gets the same “starter kit”), or specially tailored to each individual? Are souls created by God? Or are souls the inevitable, automatic product of a set of deep psychophysical laws; in other words, given specific, complex structures of atoms, do souls pop into existence? Or are souls always existing, part of a cosmic consciousness—journeying, reincarnating, transitioning, transforming, reincarnating ….?</p><p id="p5355">Notably, because consciousness, under dualism, would require both a non-physical substance and a physical brain (somehow working together), it is conceivable, following the death of the body and the dissolution of the brain, that this nonphysical substance by itself could maintain some kind of existence, conscious or otherwise. (Although this nonphysical substance is traditionally called a “soul”—a term laden with theological burdens—a soul is not the only kind of thing, or form, that such a nonphysical substance could be.)</p><p id="p5360">Philosopher Dean Zimmerman reviews “a spectrum of dualisms,” resulting from different meanings of “nonphysical”. Are souls simple, with no parts, or composite, with internal components (whether fixed or flexible)? To pose an extreme, could souls be abstract objects, outside of space and time, necessary existents? Most dualists would have souls as concrete, nonphysical objects. Some would even have souls extended in space, sharing the same special coordinate system as bodies (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib849" name="bbib849" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib849"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Zimmerman, 2005</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5365">David Bentley Hart welcomes confrontation by claiming that most early modern scientists were better able to understand the mind-body problem than are many in the sciences today. The 17th century solution to the seeming irreconcilability of mind and matter was “to adopt a casual and contented dualism, allowing the mental and the physical each its own discrete autonomous sphere: nature, not being teleological or intentional in any way, is nothing like mind; mind, not being composite, purposeless, and impersonal, is nothing like nature.” The two can somehow interact, probably, Hart suggests, through the sheer power of God, but “neither is reducible or even qualitatively similar to the other.” Hart recognizes the inherent problems in describing “any kind of coherent ontological, causal, or epistemological continuity between the two spheres”—Hart himself is a monist (14.11)—“it [dualism] was nowhere near so magnificent a disaster as the later, materialistically monistic attempts to reduce mental events to mechanical [processes] have so far proved” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib319" name="bbib319" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib319"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hart, 2019a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib354" name="bbib354" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib354"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2021a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5370">To Galen Strawson, “Dualists who postulate two distinct substances while holding that they interact causally not only face the old and seemingly insuperable problem of how to give an honest account of this interaction. They also face the (even more difficult) problem of justifying the claim that there are two substances.” To think that dualism has anything in its favor, Strawson asserts, “is simply to reveal that one thinks one knows more about the nature of things than one does—and it has Occam's razor (that blunt, sharp instrument) against it” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib739" name="bbib739" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib739"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Strawson, 2008</span></span></a>).

Property dualism</h3><p id="p5395">Property Dualism is the idea that while there is only one kind of substance in the world, physical substance, there are two kinds of properties, mental and physical properties, such that mental properties cannot be reduced to or explained by physical properties alone, even though both kinds of properties are generated by the same physical thing, namely brains. More specifically, property dualism maintains that human persons are entirely physical objects, composed wholly by the constituents of fundamental physics and subject only to the laws of physics, but also they have, at the same time and equally inherent, non-physical properties or aspects, namely mental properties or aspects (thoughts, concepts, ideas) that are not reducible to, and not explainable by, the properties of fundamental physics (and its special science derivatives)—even though all of property dualism's properties must come from those constituents of fundamental physics. Simply, human persons would have nonphysical properties but no nonphysical parts.</p><p id="p5400">According to Dean Zimmerman (following Chalmers), property dualism means that, “For at least some mental states, it is not possible to define, in terms of microphysical properties alone, a physical property common to all individuals in that mental state, and only to them.” Property dualism, then, would be the failure of supervenience, which states that “among all the possible individuals in all the possible worlds, there is no pair with all the same microphysical properties but different mental properties” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib849" name="bbib849" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib849"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Zimmerman, 2005</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5405">Zimmerman applies property dualism to two famous questions in philosophy of mind: “It seems easy to imagine physically indiscernible zombies (animate human bodies with no consciousness) or people whose spectrum of color experiences is the reverse of one's own.

If mental states cannot so arise, what then of property dualism?</p><p id="p5415">To oversimplify, property dualism is dualistic only in its deep epistemology, not in its deep ontology, which remains entirely materialistic—consciousness remains wholly the product of brain function. Under property dualism, the mind still comes entirely from the brain, without residue. When super-advanced neuroscience accounts for all that can be known about the brain—though obviously it would be fiendishly complex—will there be nothing left over to explain about the mind?</p><p id="p5420">Yet, property dualism has some mental properties as irreducible, a move that perhaps help blunt attacks on materialist theories of consciousness. (Property dualism shares features with Non-Reductive Physicalism, 10.) But what does this really mean? How irreducible? Irreducible in practice, for sure. But irreducible in principle? What would an absolute complete science, from fundamental physics to neuroscience, <em>not</em> capture?</p><p id="p5425">Philosopher Ralph Weir evaluates the common preference in philosophy of mind for varieties of property dualism over other alternatives to physicalism and certainly over substance dualism. He argues that the standard motivations for property dualism “lead directly to nonphysical substances resembling the soul of traditional metaphysics.” Using the conceivability of modal arguments for zombies and ghosts and critiquing Russellian monist forms of property dualism, he concludes that “if you posit nonphysical properties in response to the mind-body problem, then you should be prepared to posit nonphysical substances as well” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib830" name="bbib830" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib830"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Weir, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5430">Property dualism is the first subcategory under dualism because it is the most materialistic, the least dualistic, of the bunch.

Although they are both substances right enough, the division of the category ‘substance’ into the sub-categories ‘physical’ and ‘non-physical’ is an ontologically significant division. We call Descartes and Plato dualists because they think there are substances in both sub-categories.

"Of course, that will include all the physical objects, all the tables and chairs and planets and atoms. But, of course, that won't tell the whole story. You will also have to tell the story of conscious life, which is associated with each body." Swinburne asserts that in order to tell "the whole story of the world," one must "pick out subjects of experience—not just by the experiences they have, not just by the physical bodies with which they are associated" but also with "separate mental entities for which the natural word is 'soul' … If you can't bring 'soul' into the account of the world, you will not tell the whole story of the world, because you will not tell who has which conscious life" (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib752" name="bbib752" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib752"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Swinburne, 2007</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib751" name="bbib751" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib751"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Swinburne, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5470">"If the only things were physical objects, including bodies and brains, we would not be able to distinguish a case where you have the body which is presently yours and I have the body which is presently mine, from the case where you have the body which is presently mine and I have the body which is presently yours," he adds. "If physical properties and mental properties were just properties of bodies there would be no difference between these cases; " but because there are obvious differences between "you" and "me," Swinburne claims that "there must be another essential part of me which goes where I go, and this we can call my 'soul.'"

Yet body and mind both seem needed to have a human person.</p><p id="p5485">Composite dualists require both body and mind to constitute a person, where “body” generally denotates brain and “mind” generally denotates soul.

"Maybe, of course, a soul can't function on its own," he said. "Maybe it can only function when associated with a body. In that case, my continued existence would consist in it being joined to a body again, perhaps an entirely new body. I think a soul could exist on its own, but not a great deal turns on that." A body is required, Swinburne said, because "for us to interact with others, to recognize others, we need different public characteristics” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib754" name="bbib754" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib754"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Swinburne, 2016</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib468" name="bbib468" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib468"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kuhn 2016b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5495">I asked Swinburne to speculate on the essence or composition of such a soul.

"A soul has no extension. It is an 'immaterial particular', to use an old-fashioned philosophical term. It does, of course, have characteristics, properties. It has thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and so on. But the way we distinguish in practice between souls is in terms of the bodies with which they are associated because the difference between your soul and my soul, being ultimate, does not consist in their relations to our respective bodies. There is of course nothing paradoxical about the difference between souls being unanalyzable, because some differences must be ultimate; if you can analyze 'a' by 'b' and 'b' by 'c' and so on, you eventually get to things which you can't analyze, and the differences between human souls in my view are one of those things.

Stump's Thomistic dualism</h3><p id="p5505">The influential Christian scholastic philosopher St. Thomas Aquinas gives an account of the soul that is non-Cartesian in character, according to Catholic philosopher Eleonore Stump, who has Aquinas taking the soul to be something essentially immaterial or configurational but nonetheless realized in material components. This suggests, she argues, not only that Cartesian dualism isn't essential to Christianity but also that the battle lines between dualism and materialism are misdrawn (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib748" name="bbib748" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib748"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stump, 1995</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5510">Stump recognizes that because Cartesian dualism is widely regarded (among philosophers) as false, and because “it is also the case that the major monotheisms have traditionally been committed to dualism of a Cartesian sort, then in the view of many philosophers the apparent or putative falsity of Cartesian dualism becomes an embarrassment for those religions.”</p><p id="p5515">In building his alternative to a Cartesian sort of dualism (in historical context, to Plato's account of the soul), Aquinas is guided by “two complex, culturally conditioned sets of intuitions,” each of which relates to a biblical passage. The first is "dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Gen. 3:19), conveying that a human being is a material object, “made out of the same sort of constituents as the earth is,” and the second is "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it" (Eccles.12:7), conveying that a human person survives death, “because her spirit or soul continues to exist after the dissolution of her body.” Stump has Aquinas accommodating both sets of intuitions with his account of the human soul (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib748" name="bbib748" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib748"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stump, 1995</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5520">Famously, Aquinas takes the soul to be the form of the body, but, as Stump points out, “the soul not only is the form that makes this matter a living human body but also is the form that makes the matter this human being.” And when, after death, all that is left of a human being is the soul, “individuality persists on Aquinas's account.”</p><p id="p5525">“Soul” is a larger category for Aquinas, his generic term for the substantial forms of all material objects that are living. Plants have souls, not in the human sense, but in that they enable “a configuration of matter which allows for nutrition, growth, reproduction.” Animals, too, have souls, since they, too, are living things; but the configuration of their matter also allows them perception. The forms that constitute human beings allow a more distinctive set of capacities, namely, intellective processes. Aquinas tends to call the human soul “the intellective soul” or “the rational soul”.</p><p id="p5530">Aquinas's soul is created directly by God and infused into matter. The soul is the act of the body, “because it is in virtue of the soul that something is actually a living human body.” Moreover, because the soul is the form of the body, it has a spatial location; while the body is alive, the soul is located where the body is.</p><p id="p5535">As for the post-mortem, disembodied soul, while it does persist, it is not the complete human being who was the composite but only a part of that human being. A separated soul does exist on its own after death, but it nonetheless isn't a substance in its own right. Disembodied existence isn't natural to the soul.</p><p id="p5540">Stump sums up: “The soul is an essentially configurational state which is immaterial and subsistent, able to exist on its own apart from the body. On the other hand, the soul is the form that makes the living human body what it is. While it is possible with divine help for the soul to exist and exercise cognitive function on its own, apart from the body, that state is unnatural to it. In the natural condition, human cognitive functions are to be attributed to the whole composite and not to the soul alone, although the composite exercises cognitive functions by means of the soul.” In Stump's view, the real lesson of Aquinas's account of the soul is to show that the dichotomy between materialism and dualism is misleading (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib748" name="bbib748" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib748"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stump, 1995</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec15.6"><h3 id="sectitle0895" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">15.6. Feser's neo-Thomistic, neo-Aristotelian, common-sense dualism</h3><p id="p5545">Catholic philosopher Edward Feser's account of consciousness combines a neo-Thomistic view that some mental faculties are immaterial and a neo-Aristotelian view that we perceive the world actually as it appears to be (i.e., direct realism, such that color and sound are properties of external objects as real as size and shape) (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib247" name="bbib247" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib247"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012a</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib248" name="bbib248" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib248"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2012b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib249" name="bbib249" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib249"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2012c</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib250" name="bbib250" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib250"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2022a</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib251" name="bbib251" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib251"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2022b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5550">As Feser explains, Aristotelians and Thomists use the term “intellect” as that faculty by which we grasp abstract concepts, make judgments and reason logically. Intellect is to be distinguished from “imagination,” the faculty by which we form mental images (visual, auditory, etc.), and from sensation, the faculty by which we perceive the external material world and the internal world of the body. Feser argues that the irreducibility of intellect to imagination and sensation is undeniable (e.g., the intellect's concepts are universals while mental images and sensations are particulars). He also argues that “the reason why intellectual activity cannot in principle be reduced to sensation or imagination is, as it happens, related to the reason why intellectual activity cannot in principle be reduced to, or entirely supervenient upon, or in any other way explicable in terms of material processes of any sort” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib247" name="bbib247" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib247"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5555">To explain intellectual activity entirely in terms of material processes, Feser says, is to inevitably deny the existence of some essential aspect of the intellectual activity. If you identify thought with material processes, you are necessarily committed to denying, implicitly or explicitly, that our thoughts really ever have any determinate or unambiguous content. According to Feser, some materialists have seen this, including Quine and Dennett, and decided “to bite the bullet and accept that the content of all thought and language is inherently indeterminate.”</p><p id="p5560">Feser asserts that such claims are indefensible because it would contradict making sense of mathematics and logic, and hence of empirical science, all of which presupposes that we have determinate concepts. “Anyone who thinks that thought can even in principle be entirely material,” he says, “hasn't thought carefully enough about the nature of thought” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib247" name="bbib247" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib247"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5565">But Feser's dualism is not Descartes's dualism, which makes assumptions about the nature of matter as much as or more than assumptions about the nature of mind, and thus is responsible, in part, for generating the mind-body problem. The key point, Feser says, is that by characterizing matter in purely quantitative, mathematical terms, Descartes left no place in it for qualitative features like color, odor, taste, sound, smell, heat and cold as common sense understands them. Accordingly, he treated these qualitative features—as Galileo before him and countless others after him did—as entirely mind-dependent, existing only in our conscious experience of the world but not in the world itself (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib248" name="bbib248" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib248"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5570">This means that if these qualitative features as common sense understands them exist only in the mind and not in the material world, it follows that these features cannot themselves be material. A kind of dualism follows, Feser claims, precisely from the materialist conception of matter. The so-called “qualia problem” that contemporary philosophers of mind fret over, he argues, “is the inevitable result of the conception of matter to which modern scientists in their philosophical moments have wedded themselves” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib248" name="bbib248" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib248"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5575">In Feser's reading, Descartes and other moderns had an austere concept of nature as inherently devoid of the qualitative features we know from conscious experience (e.g., color, sound, heat, cold) as well as of meaning or purpose of any kind. Thus, they conceived of the human mind as an immaterial substance that somehow interacts with those parts of the natural world we call human bodies and brains. This spawns Descartes's novel form of dualism, which is notoriously problematic (i.e., the interaction problem) such that modern materialists throw out Descartes's immaterial substance while holding on to his view of the material world. (But their own position, Feser adds, is even more problematic, since it leaves them with no place at all to locate qualitative features or meaning.) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib249" name="bbib249" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib249"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012c</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5580">Moreover, because Descartes took the human body as just one entirely mathematically definable bit of the material world among others, entirely devoid of qualitative features, and took all consciousness to reside in the <em>res cogitans</em>, which he regarded as immaterial, Descartes's position implies that sensation and imagination are immaterial. Hence if sensation and imagination turn out to be material after all, it is understandable how some would infer that all operations of the <em>res cogitans</em>, all mental activity, might be susceptible to materialist explanation as well (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib248" name="bbib248" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib248"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5585">But, Feser argues, the Aristotelian tradition has always regarded sensation and imagination as corporeal faculties, and as having nothing essentially to do with the reasons why our distinctively intellectual activities are incorporeal, in that strictly intellectual activity on the one hand and sensation and imagination on the other, differ in kind, not merely in degree, so that to establish the corporeal nature of the latter is irrelevant to the question of whether the former is corporeal.</p><p id="p5590">Aristotle and the Scholastic tradition that built on his thought took the common-sense view that the natural world is filled with irreducibly different kinds of objects and qualities: people; dogs and cats; trees and flowers; rocks, dirt, and water; colors, odors, sounds; heat and cold; meanings and purposes (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib249" name="bbib249" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib249"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2012c</span></span></a>). The founders of modern philosophy and science overthrew Aristotelianism, and, on Feser's view, common sense along with it. On the new view of nature inaugurated by Galileo and Descartes, the material world is comprised of nothing more than colorless, odorless, soundless, meaningless, purposeless particles in motion, describable in purely mathematical terms. The differences between dirt, water, rocks, trees, dogs, cats, and human bodies are on this view superficial.</p><p id="p5595">Common sense, Feser says, takes ordinary physical objects to have both (a) size, shape, motion, etc. and (b) color, sound, heat, cold, etc. Early modern philosophers and scientists characterized features of type (a) as “primary qualities” and features of type (b) as “secondary qualities,” and they argued that the latter are not genuine features of matter as it is in itself, but reflect only the way conscious awareness <em>presents</em> matter to us. What exists in mind-independent reality is nothing more than particles in motion. Color, sound, taste, odor, etc. exist only in the mind's experiences of that reality (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib250" name="bbib250" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib250"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2022a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5600">But, Feser argues, to draw a sharp distinction between primary and secondary qualities is much more difficult than it at first appears. The Aristotelian philosopher who defends common sense would say that this is a good reason to think that secondary qualities are, after all, as objective as primary qualities.</p><p id="p5605">The more common approach, however, was to try to make some version of the primary/secondary quality distinction work, which made a Cartesian sort of dualism an inevitable consequence of the primary/secondary quality distinction. For if color, sound, heat, cold, etc. as common sense understands them don't exist in <em>matter</em>, then they don't exist in the <em>brain</em> or the rest of the body (since those are material). And if they do nevertheless exist in the <em>mind</em>, then we have the dualist conclusion that the mind is not identical with the brain or with any other material thing.</p><p id="p5610">Feser claims that the very conception of matter that modern materialism has committed itself to is therefore radically incompatible with materialism. Attempting to develop a materialist account of consciousness <em>while at the same time</em> presupposing the conception of matter inherited from Galileo and Co. is like trying to square the circle. “It is a fool's errand,” Feser opines, “born of conceptual confusion and neglect of intellectual history” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib250" name="bbib250" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib250"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Feser, 2022a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5615">To Feser, the hard problem of consciousness is a pseudo-problem. It arises only if we follow Galileo and his successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and other “secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common sense supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you take this position, Feser says, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material.</p><p id="p5620">The solution, Feser offers, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter.

Moreland's Christian soul</h3><p id="p5630">Christian philosopher J.P. Moreland defines a robust “generic substance dualism” as the view according to which “(i) there is a substantial soul (self, ego, I, substantial form) that is wholly immaterial; (ii) the soul is not identical to its physical body; and (iii) the soul is that which grounds personal identity for human persons” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib555" name="bbib555" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib555"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Moreland, 2023</span></span></a>). He defends a Thomistic-like dualism, taking the body to be an ensouled, spatially extended, physical structure, and the soul to be a substantial, unified reality that informs (gives form to) its body, animates it and makes it human. Thus, a body requires a soul to be a body, and this is why a body is of value. A body without a soul in it is just a corpse. In contrast to a body, a corpse is of little intrinsic value (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib553" name="bbib553" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib553"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Moreland, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5635">Similarly, a soul requires a body to be fully realized; for a soul to have a body is its natural state. By analogy, the soul is to the body like God is to space—it is fully “present” at each point within the body. Breaking the analogy, Moreland's soul and body relate to each other in an informing and cause-effect way (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib553" name="bbib553" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib553"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Moreland, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5640">Moreland argues that the unity of consciousness cannot be explained if a person is a brain, because a brain is just an aggregate of different physical (separable) parts. He accepts constituent realism regarding properties (and relations), according to which properties (and relations) are universals that, when exemplified (they need not exist), become constituents of the ordinary particulars that have them. Moreover, he asserts that whereas a physicalist may claim a unified awareness of one's visual field consists of combining several different physical parts of the brain each terminating a different wavelength, each of which is aware of only part (not the whole) of the complex view, “this cannot account for the single, unitary awareness of the entire visual field” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib554" name="bbib554" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib554"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Moreland, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5645">Offering “a comprehensive defense of contemporary substance dualism,” Christian philosophers Brandon Rickabaugh and J.P.

Interactive dualism</h3><p id="p5650">The primary problem of Dualism—many would say the <em>defeater</em> of Dualism—is how nonphysical substances could possibly interact with physical substances, especially given the common assumption that the physical world is a closed system. Also called the "pairing problem," how could an immaterial thing, the mind, interact with a material thing, the body (or brain)? Notwithstanding our folk perception that the physical world affects my mind through my senses and my mind affects the physical world through my actions, most scientists and philosophers deny this is what is in fact happening. There would be no commonalities between physical and nonphysical substances, no means of exchange—the problem of mental causation on steroids. Moreover, if nonphysical substances could somehow affect and alter physical substances, wouldn't that require a transference of energy, and wouldn't such an addition violate the sacrosanct physical law of the conservation of energy? (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib652" name="bbib652" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib652"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Robinson, 2023</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib395" name="bbib395" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib395"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Interactionism, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5655">Advocates of Interactive Dualism (not that there are many among scientists and philosophers) say they have resources. They reject the weak dualism of Epiphenomenalism where the physical affects the mental but the mental does not affect the physical (9.1.2). They can claim that the interaction problem is founded on archaic 19th century, billiard-ball physics, where causation requires hard substances to be in physical contact, to touch one another, as it were. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, allows for various, albeit speculative ways, for the mental to affect the physical, even beyond the classic but controversial view that an “observer” is needed to “collapse” the wave function. Moreover, because quantum mechanics introduces fundamental uncertainty into the universe, and if by this indeterminism holds, nonphysical substances might enjoy “wiggle room” to effect causation.</p><p id="p5660">Advocates can also appeal to different kinds of ethereal forces or energy transference systems. Perhaps mental powers can influence the <em>distribution</em> but not the quantity of energy in the brain (“a little more here, a little less there” does seem a bit of a cheat). Perhaps each individual brain is not a causally closed system so that the conservation of energy need not apply. Perhaps causal closure for the entire universe is also a 19th century invention, based on classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, which are now superseded by quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter, dark energy, and who knows what else? (I can make up another. Since string theory offers, depending on flavor, 10, 11 or 26 “compactified” extra dimensions, why couldn't nonphysical substances work via these extra dimensions? I can conceive of a precedent for this. To account for the “hierarchy problem” in physics, where gravity is vastly weaker than the other fundamental forces, some postulate that gravity “leaks” or “bleeds” into these extra dimensions.) It gets crazy.</p><p id="p5665">That's not all. Perhaps, one could just blow away the interaction problem by just asserting that in systems that have minds, the law of conservation of energy is false. Perhaps because downward causation goes to the lower physical levels and emergence is enabled, the causal completeness of physics is wrong (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib238" name="bbib238" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib238"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ellis, 2019</span></span></a>). Further, because the whole idea of a closed physical system is based on the assumption that there are no nonphysical forces involved, wouldn't this assumption undermine the argument against interaction by making it circular? Then there is “overdetermination,” where mental and physical factors can each, independently, affect actions—an approach that, while possibly solving one problem, creates other problems (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib652" name="bbib652" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib652"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Robinson, 2023</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib395" name="bbib395" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib395"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Interactionism, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5670">Finally, there is always a theological solution. God can help. God could have created souls with powers, especially since “real” (i.e., libertarian) free will is an essential part of “God's plan,” such that neither conservation of energy nor determinism holds, at least with respect to minds. (It is challenging how even God could make this coherent.)</p><p id="p8655">Christian philosopher William Lane Craig describes himself as a “dualist-interactionalist” in that “the brain is itself part of... the physical reality with which the soul immediately interacts (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib853" name="bbib853" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib853"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Craig, 2015</span></span></a>). He argues that even though souls do not have spatial locations, “the question becomes why we should think that only spatial relations can pair a cause with its effect.

This would mean that while mind and body appear to interact, in fact it is God that is changing each separately and ceaselessly. While Occasionalism is dismissed (often ridiculed), there is a kind of logic here. If God acts as intermediary, as it were, between nonphysical and physical substances, then because God would have created both in the first place, this would make the apparent causal connection between nonphysical and physical substances not especially troublesome for God to bring about. This way of thinking—all these possible mechanisms for Interactive Dualism—reflects the depth of Dualism's problem.</p></section><section id="sec15.9"><h3 id="sectitle0910" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">15.9.

The resultant new substance that emerges would be nonphysical, generated by some meta-psychophysical processes or laws, and it would become the first-person subject of the mind or consciousness.

Dualism's “pairing problem”—how can nonphysical substances (“souls”) have causal relations with physical substances (brains) with zero tolerance for failure?—would be reduced under emergent dualisms because (i) souls would seem in a way tethered in space (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib849" name="bbib849" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib849"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Zimmerman, 2005</span></span></a>), and (ii) souls would have been generated by physical substances (brains) in the first place.</p><p id="p5690">As a theist, Richard Swinburne holds the creationist position that God creates anew each new soul.

And once this nonphysical substance (soul) comes into existence, it is then logically possible for this “soul” to become independent of its progenerating physical substance (brain) and to maintain its existence beyond the dissolution of the physical (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib460" name="bbib460" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib460"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kopel, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5700">Finally, there would be no necessity that the kind of meta-psychophysical laws that generate emergent dualism should be restricted to complex arrangements of atoms in biological entities or contexts.

Kind's dualism 2.0</h3><p id="p5705">Philosopher Amy Kind defends dualism 2.0, “a thoroughly modern version of dualism … decoupled from any religious or non-scientific connotations.” Her argument is direct and forceful: “A physicalist framework cannot adequately capture the full reality of our conscious experience”—which has a “qualitative nature.” However physicalism is defined, she says, “whether it's in terms of current physics or future physics, or some other way entirely—we should see the theory as committed to an important constraint: Physicalism can be true only if the phenomenality is not a primitive aspect of the world” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 4, 58).</p><p id="p5710">She analyzes and rejects Materialist Theories of Representationalism (9.8) and High-order Theories (9.8.3), and Russellian Monism (14.1), and she deflects the counterattack that “rejecting physicalism is tantamount to believing in ghosts, or fairy dust, or magic.” She stresses that “the claim that consciousness is not a physical thing does not commit one to the existence of spooky stuff. Rather, it should be seen as perfectly consistent with an adoption of a broadly naturalistic conception of the world and our place in it.” She calls Dualism 2.0 “a rebooted version of dualism … what it looks like to adopt this kind of view from the vantage point of the 21st century” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, p. 5).</p><p id="p5715">Kind's claim is a simple one: “Just as physical states, events, and processes are an irreducibly real part of the world, so too are phenomenal states, events, and processes an irreducibly real part of the world” (jointly, “activity”). Given “the existence of both phenomenal activity and physical activity, and further, in virtue of its claim that these two kinds of activity cannot be reduced to one another,” she declares that “the view is appropriately characterized as dualistic.” Immediately, however, she stresses that “this duality need not be thought of in terms of mental substances. We can have duality of activity without duality of entities” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, p. 53).</p><p id="p5720">While obviously distinct from physicalism, Kind's dualism 2.0 distinguishes itself from Russellian Monism (and Panpsychism, 13), because, although the “claim that phenomenality (or protophenomenality) can be found at the fundamental level of reality … is consistent with dualism 2.0 … it is not required by it.” Dualism 2.0, she says, “need not take mass and charge to be the appropriate model for phenomenality.” Nor does dualism 2.0 “commit itself to the ubiquity of phenomenality,” nor “to anything spooky.” Just because “something cannot be reduced to the physical” does not mean, ipso facto, “that it is magical or mystical.” Her example is mathematics (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib450" name="bbib450" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib450"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kind and Stoljar, 2023</span></span></a>, pp. 53–54).</p><p id="p5725">What about the physicalist argument that specifying the putative phenomenal laws seems a project from nowhere?

Soul in the Hebrew Bible and Jewish philosophy</h3><p id="p5730">If one wants to pay attention to the nature of consciousness or soul in the Hebrew scriptures (which is recognized as foundational by traditional Christianity and Islam as well as by Judaism), there are two essential words to consider: “<em>nephesh</em>” (נֶפֶשׁ), often translated as “soul,” and “<em>ruach</em>” (רוּחַ), often translated “spirit.” Neither word is translated consistently, nor does either map cleanly unto modern meanings of soul or consciousness.</p><p id="p5735">The essential verse for <em>nephesh</em> is Genesis 2:7: “God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,” and “the man became a living being (or soul, <em>nephesh</em>).” If <em>nephesh</em> is translated “soul,” that “soul” was not immortal (in that it had to be described as “living”); it was not a nonphysical substance <em>given</em> to the man, but rather it was what the man <em>became</em>. <em>Nephesh</em> applies to all sentient creatures, not just to humans, and although mostly translated “soul”, it is elsewhere translated as life, person, creature, mind, heart (emotions), desires. There are several places where the context seems to require that nephesh be translated “dead”—it would be an odd coupling, indeed, for <em>nephesh</em> to be an immortal soul and at the same time be dead.</p><p id="p5740">The first use of <em>ruach</em> in the Hebrew bible is Genesis 1:2, where it is the “spirit” (<em>ruach</em>) of God that is hovering in the darkness over the surface of the waters of a formless and desolately empty earth. But <em>ruach</em> is elsewhere translated “wind” (many verses), as well as vigor, courage, anger, disposition, patience, desire, even mind as the seat of mental acts or moral courage. Ruach is used in “holy spirit” as well as in God's spirit. While neither <em>nephesh</em> nor <em>ruach</em> means soul or consciousness, <em>ruach</em> seems closer to a mental designator and <em>nephesh</em> closer to a living body designator.</p><p id="p5745">Philosopher and rabbi Aaron Segal offers a defense of a traditional Judaic view that there are souls and that they exist long before being embodied. Responding to the materialist challenge that it's very surprising that none of us remembers anything from before we were born, he proposes that each of us has “been <em>in existence</em> for a very long time" but "only came to be a thinking thing at a certain point in the development of her body (or brain).” Other respectable metaphysical views, he argues, “have us existing for just as long and undergoing transformations no less radical than this. For example, according to one prominent view, anything that ever exists, always existed and always will exist. Nothing really goes into or out of existence. What looks like going into and out of existence is just a matter of going from being abstract (with no causal powers and no location, like a feature) to being concrete (with causal powers and a particular location, like a person), and back again. An immaterialist who goes this route need not maintain that any of us has undergone a transformation so radical as from the abstract to the concrete: just from unthinking to thinking” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib588" name="bbib588" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib588"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Olson and Segal, 2023</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib692" name="bbib692" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib692"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Segal, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5750">Segal then moves to a view he calls “closer to home”: animalism—a prominent version of materialism that each of us is a human organism. “Quite plausibly,” he says, “animalism has as a consequence that each of us was once an unthinking fetus. So, according to that prominent version of materialism, each of us has undergone a transformation from an unthinking thing to a thinking thing.”</p><p id="p5755">Physicist/businessman Eduard Shyfrin, who has developed a “Kabbalah of Information” framework that integrates information theory with the Jewish mystical tradition, calls the Kabbalah soul “the information entity with the dimension of self that is structurally part of the informational foundations of the worlds (The Tree of Sefirot)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib707" name="bbib707" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib707"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Shyfrin, n.d.</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5760">The Kabbalah of Information, Shyfrin says, holds that God created only information, nothing else, as the building blocks of all reality. Thus, there is no fundamental difference between material and spiritual. Creation is an information space (“infospace”), composed of concepts of different complexity and dimensionality. The distance between concepts in infospace is measured by the likeness of their meaning, generating a form of hierarchy of concepts or “worlds”—as determined by the Kabbalah Law of Likeness. Moreover, all the worlds are structurally invariant; the Tree of Sefirot has a fractal structure. The transfer from one concept to another is incremental; it takes place when information change reaches an “error threshold” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib708" name="bbib708" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib708"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Shyfrin, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5765">Based on the above, Shyfrin explains that the “soul” is the information structure similar to the structure of the “worlds” (Tree of Sefirot), with the additional dimension of “self.” This structural similarity allows for the smooth interaction between the soul and the Tree of Sefirot. Souls can “move” in infospace, which, for example, is the process of learning and thinking. All souls intrinsically have the same kinds of concepts in general, but in particular, souls are distinguished by their taking concepts from different parts of the hierarchy of concepts.

Yet there are opposing views; for example, Peter van Inwagen's “Christian materialism” (10.3) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib811" name="bbib811" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib811"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Van Inwagen, 1995</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5780">Biblical scholar James Tabor points out that although many assume that the New Testament abandons the Hebrew view of the “soul” (<em>nephesh)</em> as simply a “living being,” referring in Genesis 1 to all breathing creatures, such is not the case. The Greek term usually translated “soul” (<em>ψυχή psykhḗ/psychi</em>) essentially means “life,” and thus refers to a living “breathing” being; so that rather than <em>having</em> souls, humans <em>are</em> souls. The central concept is that of breathing or not breathing—which equates to being alive or dead. Thus “soul” is most often used for the “self,” which is the “whole” being and it can be destroyed along with the body (Matthew 10:28). Thus, we read of “fear coming upon every soul” meaning every individual (Acts 2:23) or Jacob's children numbering “seventy-five souls”—or persons (Acts 7:14). The Apostle Paul metaphorically speaks of the dead as “asleep”—no longer conscious or breathing, so that resurrection is an “awakening” in a new transformed body. Without the resurrection they would “perish” (1 Corinthians 15:18). Likewise, giving up the “spirit” (<em>pneuma</em>) is to breathe one's last breath and die (John 19:30) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib756" name="bbib756" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib756"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tabor, 1989</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib759" name="bbib759" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib759"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tabor, 2023b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib761" name="bbib761" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib761"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">TaborBlog</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5785">“But, of course, what I assert here can be contested,” Tabor adds, especially by Christian apologists and theologians who consider the subsequent idea of the immortal soul fundamental to Christianity.

Building on ancient and Neo-Platonist philosophers, medieval Islamic philosophers, mainly al-Kindî, al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, developed an Islamic metaphysic of the soul by evaluating the concepts of intellect, soul, <em>nafs</em> and body. Especially important is <em>nafs</em>, which literally means “self,” but can be translated “<em>psyche</em>” and “soul.” In building an Islamic theory of consciousness, the relationship between the soul and body is shaped by the unification of the soul with the body, the soul's effect on the body, the soul's independence, the state of the body, the separation of the soul after the body's death, and whether the soul preserves its individuality (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib789" name="bbib789" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib789"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Islamic Soul-Body, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5825">Avicenna has the soul in an accidental relation to a particular body, given that body's need for a central organizing and sustaining principle. “The soul itself is generated by the separate intelligences of the heavens and emanated by them upon the body” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib397" name="bbib397" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib397"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ivry, 2012</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5830">Averroes focuses on the hierarchical structure of the soul, with each faculty sustained by a lower, more material, or less “spiritual,” faculty.

That's what paradise is. And even within paradise, there are levels. The highest paradise is called the paradise of the essence, in which every single concept and idea and limited form of existence is transcended beyond the paradisal estate in the ordinary sense.”</p><p id="p5850">The state of the soul, Nasr says, is “meta cosmic,” a kind of merging without destruction of the individual. “It's what Meister Eckhart called ‘fusion without confusion’—a beautiful expression.

Either way, I'm not sure how much more extravagance any of this adds to the fact that souls are coming into existence <em>ex nihilo</em> in the first place.

Swami Vivekananda describes the Samkhyan approach to consciousness: “Mind, intelligence, will, and everything else is insentient. But they are all reflecting the sentiency, the <em>cit</em> [consciousness] of some being who is beyond all this, whom the Samkhya philosophers call <em>puruṣha</em>.” Thus, Samkhya has a metaphysical dualism between conscious spirit and insentient matter. Fundamentally, even the mind (<em>antaḥkaraṇa</em>) is actually a subtle form of insentient matter, but it <em>appears</em> to be conscious because of the “light” of the <em>puruṣha</em> behind it (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib533" name="bbib533" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib533"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Medhananda, 2022</span></span></a>).

In plant and animal life, consciousness begins to emancipate a little, there are the first signs of exchange, of giving and taking, of feelings, drives and emotions. In the human mind we see a further emancipation of consciousness in the first appearance of an ability to ‘play with ideas in one's mind’ and to rise above the immediate situation.” The mind, however, constitutes opposing characteristics. On the one hand, it is “the plane of objective, generalized statements, ideas, thoughts, intelligence, etc.” On the other hand, it “is also an inveterate divider, making distinctions between subject and object, I and thou, things and other things” (Cornelissen, 2004).</p><p id="p5915">From the Vedic perspective, “ordinary human mentality is considered to be only the most primitive form of mental consciousness, most ego-bound, most dependent on the physical senses. Above it there is the unitary Higher Mind of self-revealed wisdom, the Illumined Mind where truths are seen rather than thought, the plane of the Intuitive Mind where truth is inevitable and perfect, and finally the cosmic Overmind, the mind of the Gods, comprehensive, all-encompassing.” But one must rise beyond all of them to find ultimate perfection, “one with the divine consciousness that upholds the universe” (Cornelissen, 2004).</p><p id="p5920">While various spiritual traditions have set life's highest goal as connecting or even merging with the absolute consciousness, Sri Aurobindo distinguishes his vision by announcing, “It is at this moment for the first time becoming possible to let a supramental consciousness enter into one's being and transform it in every respect.” It is this “comprehensive, supramental transformation of all aspects of human nature” that is the central theme of Sri Aurobindo's work—and it is his grand prediction that human progress via the evolution of consciousness will eventually bring about “supramental consciousness as much an intrinsic, ‘natural’ part of earthly life as our ordinary mentality is now” (Cornelissen, 2004).</p><p id="p5925">According to Ravi Gomatam, a quantum physicist and a monk of the <em>Gaudiya Vaishnava</em> (GV) <em>Vedanta</em> school of India, GV Vedanta is monotheistic, with a pluralist ontology that distinguishes between the energetic personal God (<em>shaktiman</em>) and the diverse energies (<em>shaktis</em>) such as consciousness and matter, which emanate from God. Both the energetic personal God (the Universal "I”) and his diverse energies, which include consciousness and matter, are ontologically real. While the material atoms lack consciousness and therefore are indistinguishable, the plane of non-material consciousness comprises innumerable individual units of consciousness, each with its own unique “I” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib307" name="bbib307" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib307"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomatam, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5930">Yet, Gomatam says, GV Vedanta is uniquely compatible with the materialistic perspective informing modern cognitive science—namely that thinking, feeling, willing, intelligence, and even our present sense of “I” spring entirely from matter. This is via the GV Vedanta idea that many properties of consciousness can be separated from consciousness and instantiated in appropriate complementary “levels of matter,” a novel technical concept that Gomatam is introducing through his work in the foundations of quantum mechanics. He says it is different from the prevailing idea of hierarchy of matter at various scales in physics.</p><p id="p5935">The color, size and shape of an apple can be instantiated on paper. A plastic apple may instantiate even further properties of the apple, such as its 3-dimensional shape, weight and texture. In either case, the apple itself is not reduced to the painting or the plastic object that instantiates its properties. Similarly, Gomatam explains, GV Vedanta allows various traits of consciousness to be instantiated sans consciousness in matter at various “levels” of matter, which are mutually exclusive, causal realms that complement one another, with each higher level not being constituted by its lower levels (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib306" name="bbib306" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib306"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomatam, 1987</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5940">Even though matter instantiates properties such as thinking, feeling, experience and even an “I” via an apparent self onto these levels of matter, matter itself is not aware it carries these cognitive and affective properties. Only consciousness can know matter has these properties.</p><p id="p5945">GV Vedanta further explains that we mistake these materially instantiated traits to be part of our intrinsic consciousness due to <em>maya</em> (illusion), imposed upon the individual souls in the material world by the Universal Person (<em>purushottama</em>), from whom all individual “I”s emanate, but who is different from them. In this way, Gomatam suggests that GV Vedanta can contribute novel, sophisticated notions of levels of matter to instantiate various features of consciousness, without reducing consciousness itself to matter. Gomatam points out that here GV Vedanta differs from Advaita Vedanta, which holds both matter and individual “I”s to be ultimately non-existent, and admits only an impersonal Universal “I”. Jainism and Buddhism, two other schools of Indian thought, additionally treat the Universal “I,” personal or impersonal, to be also non-existent (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib307" name="bbib307" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib307"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Gomatam, 2021</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec15.16"><h3 id="sectitle0945" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">15.16.

While it is not fruitful to try to discern the metaphysics of what is designated by some aborigines as "spirit of the man," or "spirit in the man," there is certainly widespread belief in the existence of forces, powers and entities beyond their physical worlds (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib651" name="bbib651" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib651"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Rivière, 1987, 2005</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5965">Whether these beliefs can be classified as substance dualism as presently conceived is debatable, although numerous examples show that “there exists a quite noticeable distinction between the body element and the diversity of spiritual entities that one may call ‘souls’ for the sake of convenience, entities that may have the body as a prop.” What James Frazer in <em>The Golden Bough</em> called the “external soul” has some characteristics of dualism's souls or spirits, such as the capacity to depart the body during dreams. (Differences include, for example, the external soul living in an animal double or in one's shadow.)</p><p id="p5970">The origin of the indigenous soul, compared with that of dualism's soul, also has similarities (e.g., coming from an almighty spirit) and differences (e.g., obtained as a gift or by conquest or by choice). The Ewe of Togo use specific, separate terms for the "substance of the soul" and the "breath of life," and believe that the individual, before incarnation, exists as a spirit, and together with the supreme creator (Mawu-Lisa) he or she chooses their own destiny. Other indigenous groups have very physical means to obtain souls, such as pilgrimage, fasting, eating, combat and killing (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib651" name="bbib651" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib651"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Rivière, 1987, 2005</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p5975">Regarding its destiny after death, souls can reach new worlds in which to live or be transmitted as a vital force to descendants.

This includes the brain, of course, but it also includes the liver, the kidney, the heart, etc. each with its own essence or contribution, thus forming “an integrated consciousness system.” “Shen” (神) is the TCM concept corresponding to “consciousness” and the classic TCM text (<em>Huangdi Neijing</em>) describes “how to understand the meaning of Shen in the heart, soul in the liver, meaning in the spleen, soul in the lungs, essence in the kidney, and will.” According to TCM theory, “the human body is a little universe.

This does not mean that there is some process of thinking in the atom.” Rather, "’atomic consciousness' could be its ability to ‘perceive’ or ‘identify’ atoms with which it has affinity, responding to them by forming molecules” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib172" name="bbib172" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib172"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Consciousness, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6035">In Theosophy's telling, there are many levels of consciousness, “depending on the plane or body through which it manifests.” In addition, the difference between consciousness and self-consciousness is also important, “since the latter is said to be a special feature that is fully developed only in human beings, especially in connection to the physical plane” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib172" name="bbib172" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib172"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Consciousness, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6040">A contemporary Theosophy thinker is Edi Bilimoria, an engineer, classical musician and life-long student of perennial philosophy.

He explains “how it is possible to develop higher faculties of consciousness—Imagination, Inspiration, and Intuition”—and how humanity could “gradually take in hand its own destiny through the conscious and free development of spiritual capacities.” He devoted much of his teaching to the esoterica of consciousness and soul, describing vividly “one's life after death and the progress of the individual through the planetary spheres where tasks and goals for future incarnations are prepared in cooperation with the spiritual beings of the Hierarchies” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib732" name="bbib732" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib732"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Steiner, 1923a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6055">Steiner differentiates consciousness from “soul life,” though they are obviously related. His consciousness is a “continuous stream of visualizations,” while it is “not the same thing as the continuous stream of the soul life.” Moreover, “a visualization can live on in the soul without entering consciousness.” This relates to memories, which are usually not conscious and are held in our soul life, and “in order to be conscious of them [memories] we must first call them up out of the unconscious life of the soul by an act of will.” Consciousness, Steiner says, “illuminates but a part of the soul life” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib731" name="bbib731" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib731"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Steiner, 1909</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6060">Steiner defines consciousness in (at least) two ways: (i) the overlapping in the present of the current (streams or flows) of emotions coming out of the future and the current of visualizations flowing out of the past; and (ii) the meeting of the astral and etheric bodies (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib731" name="bbib731" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib731"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Steiner, 1909</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib733" name="bbib733" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib733"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">1923b</span></span></a>). What does this mean?</p><p id="p6065">Steiner states that “the riddles of consciousness will be solved and the whole peculiar nature of the soul life clarified if you start with the premise that the current of desire, love and hate comes to meet you out of the future, and meets the current of visualizations flowing out of the past into the future. At every moment you are actually in the midst of this encounter of the two streams, and considering that the present moment of your soul life consists of such a meeting, you will readily understand that these two currents overlap in your soul. <em>This overlapping is consciousness</em>” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib731" name="bbib731" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib731"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Steiner, 1909</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6070">To get a sense of how such overlapping happens, one begins with Steiner's description of the human being as having seven distinct members, the first three of which are “bodies”—physical, etheric, astral—and the fourth is Ego or I. The <em>physical body</em> covers the workings of physics and chemistry. The <em>etheric</em> body or “life body” describes forces or energy fields that are spatial and take the form of our physical body. The <em>astral body</em> expresses affect, feelings and emotions, and has “movements,” such as expansion and contraction (reflecting positive and negative emotions, respectively).</p><p id="p6075">To Steiner, how these bodies articulate is critical. For example, “throughout the whole of an earthly life the physical body and the etheric remain together, never separating even when, in sleep, the etheric body and the astral body have to part company.” Similarly, the Ego and the astral body never “part from one another during life on Earth. In our waking state we give life to our senses through our Ego, and through the astral body to our nervous system” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib733" name="bbib733" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib733"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Steiner, 1923b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6080">Two critical elements are: (i) “clairvoyant consciousness about the etheric and astral bodies,” and (ii) “the intersection of the two streams … the two currents meet in the physical body.” In this way, Steiner harmonizes his two definitions of consciousness—overlapping streams of emotions from the future and of visualizations from the past, and the meeting of the astral and etheric bodies, the two streams intersecting in the physical body.</p><p id="p6085">What happens “when a man passes through the gate of death,” as Steiner puts it? To simplify, “The etheric body detaches itself from the physical body—something that never happens during earthly life. And now, when the etheric body is free of the physical, all that has been interwoven into the etheric body is gradually dispersed … the experiences that have gradually penetrated into the etheric body … pass out into the universal cosmic ether, and dissolve.” Steiner offers an intricate tapestry of the worlds beyond death: spiritual beings, a speaking universe, uniting with the whole Cosmos, the music of the spheres, rebirths, and more (I spare the reader the details) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib733" name="bbib733" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib733"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Steiner, 1923b</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec15.20"><h3 id="sectitle0965" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">15.20.

Idealisms</h2><p id="p6125">Idealism is consciousness as ultimate reality, the fullness of the deepest level of all existence, the singular fundamental existent. It is the theory of consciousness that takes consciousness to its maximum meaning. The focus here is ontological idealism, where ultimate reality is mind or awareness or thought, while everything else, including all physical worlds and universes and all that they contain, are derivative or illusionary. (I do not consider epistemological idealism, where all we can know is constrained by the structure of human thought.)

Though often eliciting “the incredulous stare" (in David Lewis's delightful phrase), Idealism is taken seriously by philosophers. Moreover, it is the foundation of major religious traditions, especially among those that arose in ancient India.</p><p id="p6140">To the surprise of some, Idealism as a theory of consciousness has not been fading in light of scientific advances. If anything, Idealism's explanatory star seems on the ascent, shining brighter, as consciousness maintains its mysteries and Idealism attracts more adherents.</p><p id="p6145">David Chalmers muses, “One starts as a materialist, then one becomes a dualist, then a panpsychist, and one ends up as an idealist. I don't know where this comes from, but I think the idea was something like this. First, one is impressed by the successes of science, endorsing materialism about everything and so about the mind. Second, one is moved by problem of consciousness to see a gap between physics and consciousness, thereby endorsing dualism, where both matter and consciousness are fundamental. Third, one is moved by the inscrutability of matter to realize that science reveals at most the structure of matter and not its underlying nature, and to speculate that this nature may involve consciousness, thereby endorsing panpsychism. Fourth, one comes to think that there is little reason to believe in anything beyond consciousness and that the physical world is wholly constituted by consciousness, thereby endorsing idealism” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib137" name="bbib137" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib137"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2020d</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6150">Chalmers defines idealism broadly “as the thesis that the universe is fundamentally mental, or perhaps that all concrete facts are grounded in mental facts. As such it is meant as a global metaphysical thesis analogous to physicalism, the thesis that the universe is fundamentally physical, or perhaps that all concrete facts are grounded in physical facts. The only difference is that ‘physical’ is replaced by ‘mental.’”</p><p id="p6155">Idealists are not necessarily committed to anti-realist views about the physical world, though some are, especially among Eastern traditions. It is perfectly coherent for an idealist to regard the physical world as “real” in the sense that it exists when no one is looking; “it just has a surprising nature,” having been formed from mental fundamentals (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib137" name="bbib137" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib137"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2020d</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6160">Chalmers distinguishes three types of idealism. (i) “<em>Micro-idealism</em> is the thesis that concrete reality is wholly grounded in micro-level mentality: that is, in mentality associated with fundamental microscopic entities (such as quarks and photons).” (ii) “<em>Macro-idealism</em> is the thesis that concrete reality is wholly grounded in macro-level mentality: that is, in mentality associated with macroscopic (middle-sized) entities such as humans and perhaps non-human animals.” (iii) “<em>Cosmic idealism</em> is the thesis that concrete reality is wholly grounded in cosmic mentality: that is, in mentality associated with the cosmos as a whole or with a single cosmic entity (such as the universe or a deity)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib137" name="bbib137" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib137"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2020d</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6165">Thus, micro-idealism has all fundamental forces and particles as entirely (not in part) mental; macro-idealism privileges what we commonly call mental as somehow constituting the foundations of reality; and cosmic idealism can be conceived as kinds of pantheism or theism, though not the dominant strands, of course. Moreover, there is resonance between these three kinds of idealism with three similar kinds of panpsychism, the rough difference being that whereas in panpsychism the mental, while everywhere, is not everything; in idealism, the mental is both everything and everywhere.</p><p id="p6170">To Huston Smith, world religion expert and devotee, matter is not fundamental, but consciousness is. “Matter is like an iceberg protruding out of the sea of consciousness.” Consciousness can never be destroyed, he said, but “can oscillate between different forms,” which leads, he recognizes, to the issue of death. “We know what our consciousness is like; we can't explain it, but we can experience it. What will it be when we drop our body? Well, what we can say is if consciousness is the fundamental reality and it can't be destroyed, consciousness will continue. The light on the television screen will never go out. Now what the image on that screen will be after death, after we drop the body, we do not know.

So, then, rather than banishing mind from our picture of nature, perhaps we should reconsider the ancient intuition that nature and mind are not alien to one another precisely because nature already possesses a rational structure analogous to thought” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib357" name="bbib357" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib357"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hart, 2022b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6180">Not sufficiently contrarian, Hart then considers “the ground of the possibility [that] regular physical causation is a deeper logical coinherence of rational relations underlying all reality.” Perhaps, more to his point, “mind inhabits physical nature not as an anomaly, but as a revelation of the deepest essence of everything that exists.”</p><section id="sec16.1"><h3 id="sectitle0975" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">16.1. Indian cosmic consciousness</h3><p id="p6185">Consciousness is central to the philosophical and religious traditions that emerged on the ancient Indian subcontinent, perhaps more central to Indian philosophy and religion than it is to any other global tradition. The sophistication and subtleties of the millennia-long discussions on consciousness in Indian traditions have enriched human understanding of, and appreciation for, consciousness as core of human sentience.</p><p id="p6190">All the schools of ancient Indian philosophy were concerned with ideas about consciousness and self, which were based on the Upanishads, the late Vedic, sacred Sanskrit texts (800-300 BCE). Although the motivation was often the perennial question, “How does one [Self] overcome suffering?”, the explorations developed sophisticated philosophies and subtle ontologies (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib669" name="bbib669" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib669"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2020</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib668" name="bbib668" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib668"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2023a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6195">Speaking on <em>Closer To Truth</em>, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains why ancient Indian thinkers of all varieties—Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, etc.—were so interested in consciousness. Their central quest was to overcome suffering, he reiterates, to attain liberation of the self. “Once you do that, you see immediately that consciousness and the self are very intimately connected. I am obviously conscious. I am aware. And it is in my awareness that I experience suffering, and the struggle to liberate myself from suffering. But all of it requires consciousness. Even the search for God requires consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib670" name="bbib670" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib670"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6200">Sarvapriyananda defines consciousness as “that to which everything else appears.” So, this world, he asks, “Is it consciousness? No. Nothing in this world is consciousness because it's an object to you. Is this body consciousness? No. Because it's an object to you. Now, what about the mind, our thoughts and emotions, which would normally be taken as related to consciousness? By this elegant definition of consciousness as ‘that to which everything else appears,’ can you designate this thought or this emotion subjectively from your perspective? You can. And if you can, then even thoughts and emotions are also objects to consciousness. The result is that consciousness is clearly distinguished from all objects. Whatever appears to you belongs to material nature. And consciousness is not that. Consciousness does exactly one thing. It gives you a first-person experience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib670" name="bbib670" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib670"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2023b</span></span></a>). (“Consciousness” is the usual translation of the Vedantic term “<em>Chaitanya</em>,” although alternative English words, such as “awareness” and “sentience,” are also used.)</p><p id="p6205">The preeminence of consciousness, both intrinsically and to the self, elicited a wide diversity of speculation about what consciousness is, and how it arises and functions. “Indian philosophy had different schools, and they argued with each other fiercely. Each of the schools fashioned its own approach to consciousness and to its relationship with self. The range of beliefs parallels consciousness studies today, from materialist-reductionism to idealism. Although the ancient Indian materialists (Charvakas) were a popular school, the dominant theme of the primary Vedanta schools, especially Advaita Vedanta, became nondual idealism, ‘nondualism’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib669" name="bbib669" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib669"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2020</span></span></a>). Other schools said there are two kinds of consciousness: a personal consciousness associated with individual bodies and minds, and a cosmic consciousness associated with all bodies and minds. “You are the consciousness associated with your body and mind. And God is the consciousness associated with all bodies and minds. God is cosmic consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib670" name="bbib670" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib670"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6210">“But this goes further,” Swami Sarvapriyananda says. “How does consciousness interact with material nature? There were multiple answers from multiple schools. One is that material nature is real, and consciousness is just an expression of material nature. (There were modern materialists in ancient India!) The second school says that the universe is produced from consciousness. And who says that? Every theistic school in the world says that. If God is the creator God, and God is obviously conscious, then in some sense, consciousness produces the material universe. These are the dualists. The third school is the Samkhyan, where consciousness and matter are parallel; neither produces the other; both are fundamental, irreducible realities.”</p><p id="p6215">The fourth, Advaita Vedanta, Swami Sarvapriyananda's own school, is nondualist, “which means that you cannot solve the interaction problem. If consciousness and matter are fundamentally different, then there is no way they could interact. Where would be the place, the boundary, where interaction could occur?” So, not being able to solve the interaction problem, what to do? “Let's just stick to our experience,” he advises. “What is matter? That which appears in consciousness. And if matter appears in consciousness, then matter can be reduced to consciousness. Thus, the materialist reduces consciousness to matter, the nondualist reduces matter to consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib670" name="bbib670" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib670"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2023b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6220">Advaita Vedanta, a monistic system, eradicates the dualistic dichotomy between consciousness and its object. Even more fundamental than the mind is nondual pure consciousness. The term for this ultimate consciousness is <em>Brahman</em>, “the vast” or “the limitless” (literally, "that which expands into everything"), and it is the key concept that unifies the consciousness of the individual with the consciousness of the cosmos, which is the fundamental, nondual reality of the universe. Rather than conceiving of <em>prakriti</em>/nature as a <em>transformation</em> of <em>purusa</em>/consciousness, in Advaita Vedanta, <em>prakriti</em> is considered an <em>appearance</em> of <em>purusa</em> (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib669" name="bbib669" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib669"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6225">In the succinct expression of the <em>Mandukya</em>, the briefest of the major Upanishads, “<em>Brahman</em> is all, and the Self is <em>Brahman</em>.”</p><p id="p6230">Thus, Advaita Vedanta's nondualism asserts that each individual soul, in some literal sense, is non-different from the infinite <em>Brahman</em>. “You are that underlying reality, <em>Brahman</em>. Not you as the body; not you as the mind; not even you as the person you think yourself to be, but as an underlying consciousness that shines through, functions through, and expresses itself through this body-mind complex.” Swami Vivekananda, who introduced Vedanta to Western audiences, put it this way: “If only you knew yourselves as you truly are.” Not as a body, bound to age, decay, and die; not even as a mind, a changing, limited personality, but as an unlimited consciousness expressing itself through a mind and a body (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib669" name="bbib669" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib669"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sarvapriyananda, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6235">The modern Hindu sage Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi clarified the fundamental principles of Advaita Vedanta, as explained by philosopher/translator Michael James, an expert on Sri Ramana. With regard to consciousness, “Sri Ramana highlighted the distinction between transitive awareness (<em>suṭṭaṟivu</em> in Tamil) and intransitive awareness (<em>suṭṭaṯṟa aṟivu</em>). Transitive awareness is awareness that knows objects or phenomena, whereas intransitive awareness is awareness that knows nothing other than itself. In classical Advaita Vedanta, intransitive awareness is called pure consciousness (<em>śuddha caitanya</em>), because it is consciousness devoid of any content, and being-consciousness (<em>sat-cit</em>), not only because it is conscious only of its own being, ‘I am’, but also because it is the consciousness (<em>cit</em>) that is itself pure being (<em>sat</em>), meaning that it is what alone actually exists, so it is the one real substance (<em>vastu</em>) from which all other things derive their seeming existence, just as gold ornaments derive their existence from gold. Transitive awareness, on the other hand, is called <em>cidābhāsa</em>, meaning that it is an <em>ābhāsa</em> (semblance, likeness or reflection) of consciousness (<em>cit</em>), because it is not real consciousness, since it is consciousness of things that do not actually exist but merely seem to exist, like all the things seen in a dream. Only consciousness of what actually exists is real consciousness, and since what actually exists is only pure consciousness, it alone is real consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib409" name="bbib409" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib409"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 2012</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib410" name="bbib410" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib410"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6240">However, according to James, “these are not two separate consciousnesses, but two forms of the one and only consciousness, one form of which is consciousness as it actually is, namely intransitive awareness, and the other form of which is an unreal appearance, namely transitive awareness. Intransitive awareness is real because it is permanent, unchanging, self-existent and self-shining. It is self-existent because it exists independent of all other things, and it is self-shining because it shines by its own light of consciousness, underived from anything else. Transitive awareness, on the other hand, is impermanent and constantly changing, and it is neither self-existent nor self-shining, because it derives its seeming existence from the real existence of intransitive awareness and it shines by the light of consciousness that it borrows from intransitive awareness. Intransitive awareness is therefore the reality that underlies and supports the illusory appearance of transitive awareness, just as a rope is the reality that underlies and supports the illusory appearance of a snake. That is, we cannot be aware of anything without being aware, but we can be aware without being aware of anything, so intransitive awareness is primary and fundamental whereas transitive awareness is secondary and emergent” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib410" name="bbib410" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib410"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6245">Sri Ramana concluded that “transitive awareness (awareness of anything other than ourself) is an unreal appearance, and that the only real consciousness is pure intransitive awareness (awareness of nothing other than our own being). That is, consciousness or awareness is not an object but the reality of the subject, so no objective investigation can enable us to know consciousness as it actually is. Since we ourself are consciousness, in order to know ourself as we actually are, we need to turn our entire attention back on ourself, away from all other things”—a practice Sri Ramana called self-investigation (<em>ātma-vicāra</em>), which means “keeping our attention fixed firmly on what we actually are, namely our fundamental awareness ‘I am’, which is our very being, so he also called this practice ‘awareness-investigation’ (<em>jñāna-vicāra</em>)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib409" name="bbib409" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib409"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 2012</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib410" name="bbib410" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib410"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6250">According to artist and computer scientist Ganapathy Subramaniam, <em>Brahman</em> as "Consciousness/Awareness/Self" can be compacted to “I”. While all things can be reduced to this “I,” this “I” cannot be reduced (i.e., the Vedanta fundamental irreducible is in the first person). So, when Vedanta says, “I am that,” meaning “I am the fundamental,” it does not mean that the individual person is fundamental; rather the irreducible I is the fundamental. This leads to the declaration, "<em>Atman</em> is <em>Brahman</em>," meaning, "The Individual Consciousness is the same as Universal Consciousness" (which is the irreducible "I") (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib749" name="bbib749" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib749"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Subramaniam, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6255">Subramaniam states that “reincarnation and the interrelated concept of karma are stepping stones to understand ultimate truth. Understanding ultimate truth is called Nirvana. It's nothing more nothing less.” How do the multiple reincarnations "stop" with Nirvana? he asks rhetorically. “Nirvana means apprehending that the concept of births and deaths is an illusion and the consciousness that you truly are, does not get born or die. Consciousness is fundamental. and you are that. This is the only truth, and this obviously negates reincarnation—which is the true meaning of the statement that ‘Once you achieve Nirvana, you no longer reincarnate.’ It's simply a logical conclusion from the definition of Nirvana.”</p><p id="p6260">“Indian thought is layered and progressive, and as you move through the layers you need to abandon and evolve out of the previous one,” Subramaniam says. “Within mainstream Indian thought you have Karma theory as well as negation of Karma theory. If you look at both at the same time, it appears to be a contradiction. But if you look at both as a progression, it fits in well.”</p><p id="p6265">Consciousness qua consciousness is “incapable of experiences,” Subramaniam contends, “so, only a person (or any sentient) is capable of physical and mental experience. When you investigate who ‘you’ are, you will logically arrive at the conclusion that ‘you’ are not the person.” But you will still be experiencing all the events of life, accumulating experiences, much like in a dream or a novel or a movie or a video game. But the fact is you are not the person. Nobody is ever the person they think they are or as they appear to be.

The Advaita exculpatory answer is that when the limited personality is transcended, the divinity within is revealed. Each soul is potentially divine.

One school follows the tradition of Sri Ramakrishna (a 19th century mystic in India), and his view was that while consciousness is fundamental, the one divine consciousness is not just impersonal but also personal, and that everything in the universe in reality is one and the same Divine Consciousness, even though everything in the universe in appearance, manifests as various and diverse forms. (This might compare to the Western metaphysics of panentheistic cosmopsychism, according to which the sole reality is one cosmic consciousness, which grounds all of the individual-level consciousnesses.)

But <em>Brahman</em> is not something that's located in one place. It's everywhere. And limit in time means it does not exist earlier, it does not exist later. But <em>Brahman</em> is not something that appears and disappears. It always is. Object limitation is interesting. A table is not a chair. A horse is not a cow. But <em>Brahman</em> does not have object limitation. Consciousness does not have object limitation.

The first five reflect the five senses: eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose consciousness, tongue consciousness, and body consciousness. The sixth is mind consciousness, which integrates the five senses and provides meaning. The seventh consciousness is directed inward, toward one's private thoughts and apprehends spiritual issues; it also creates the concept of self (from which all the deception is said to come because there is no entity ‘self’). The eighth consciousness is known as “storehouse consciousness” where all our experiences, actions and deeds, are in some sense “stored,” accumulating a lifetime of karma. (The eighth consciousness persists after death, unlike the first seven that cease when the body dies.) The ninth and highest consciousness, known as the Buddha nature, is the purest, forming the foundations for one's life and serving as the core of our energy and the source for all mental and spiritual activity.

These include: “sensory and conceptual forms of consciousness; consciousness that is introspectible and consciousness that is too deep for introspection; consciousness that takes external phenomena as objects and consciousness that takes inner phenomena as objects; consciousness that is merely receptive and consciousness that is constructive and even projective. In general, the complex set of phenomena is opaque to casual introspection, and are knowable only theoretically or perhaps by highly trained meditators.” Garfield draws parallels between the nine levels and modern theories of consciousness: reflexive models of self-consciousness and self-knowledge, higher-order thought models, higher-order perception models and self-luminosity models (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib280" name="bbib280" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib280"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6330">Regarding the Buddhist approach to phenomenal consciousness, the story is complex. On the one hand, as Garfield puts it, “There is no phenomenal consciousness; there is nothing ‘that it is like’ to be me. To believe in phenomenal consciousness or ‘what-it-is-like-ness’ of ‘for-me-ness’ is to succumb to a pernicious form of the ‘Myth of the Given’.<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn54" name="bfn54" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn54"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>54</sup></span></span></a>.. the sense that there is such a kind of consciousness is an instance of cognitive illusion … The very idea that there is an inner world of qualitative states must be illusory” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib281" name="bbib281" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib281"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6335">On the other hand, there is rich tradition of Buddhist debate about perceptual consciousness and representationalism: how inner perception articulates with external objects and what we can know about the relationship. The Yogācāra school goes for idealism, “arguing that since direct realism is incoherent, as is representationalism, the direct and only object of conscious experience is an inner state,” while its worthy competitor, the Madhyamaka school, “analyzes consciousness, as they analyze all phenomena, as a set of relations, not as an independent phenomenon or characteristic.” In this deflationary account, “the illusion that there is a special property or center of consciousness is resolved in favor of a network of processes” (i.e., perceived object, sense organ, sensory system, conceptual system) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib281" name="bbib281" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib281"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6340">From the Madhyamaka perspective, all that we lose is “the illusion that there is more in conscious experience than the psychology and physiology of experience. In particular, reference to internal representations, qualia, phenomenal properties and other such ghostly mediators of our experience drop away.” Garfield argues that such a more naturalistic, more public (less private) view “forces the theorist who takes something like the qualitative character of experience to be real, and to be essential to consciousness, to defend and not to presuppose that view” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib281" name="bbib281" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib281"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6345">To go deeper into Buddhist consciousness is to go “empty.” Emptiness is a foundational concept in Buddhism and is easily misunderstood (and inappropriately ridiculed). Simply put, “Emptiness is the lack of any intrinsic nature, not another intrinsic nature instead of those we naively superimpose on entities.” Emptiness, Garfield stresses, is never “emptiness of existence” but rather “always emptiness of some more determinate metaphysical property.” As Garfield explains the doctrine of the “two truths,” illuminating Nāgārjuna (c.150 - c.250 CE), perhaps Buddhism's greatest philosopher-saint (other than the Buddha, of course), “nothing turns out to be ultimately real, everything is merely conventionally real, and the ultimate and conventional truths, while radically different in one respect, are in fact identical in another. That is the profound doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib281" name="bbib281" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib281"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6350">Applied to consciousness, if phenomenal consciousness, like everything else, is empty of intrinsic nature, its claim of qualitative distinction from all other phenomena, its claim of radical subjective experience as a nonpareil occurrence in the cosmos, would seem to weaken. Moreover, though debate abounds, whereas Madhyamaka “takes all phenomena, including mind and the external world, to be conventionally real but ultimately empty, and to be interdependent, Yogācāra takes external objects to be mere appearances to mind, to be utterly non-existent, and takes mind to be the substantially real subjective substrate of those representations,” confirming the Yogācāra position as idealist (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib280" name="bbib280" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib280"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6355">That Buddhism rejects the self, asserting that we are persons, not selves, makes for fascinating explorations (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib282" name="bbib282" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib282"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Garfield, 2022</span></span></a>).

Kastrup's modern, analytic version of the ontology of idealism asserts “(a) phenomenal consciousness, as an ontological category, is fundamental; and (b) everything else in nature can ultimately be reduced to, or grounded in, patterns of excitation of phenomenal consciousness.” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib433" name="bbib433" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib433"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2019</span></span></a>).

That these “unfathomably rich experiential states” correlate with significantly reduced activity in multiple brain areas is said to “contradict the mainstream metaphysics of physicalism for obvious reasons: experience is supposed to be generated by metabolic neuronal activity.” He dismisses “the best physicalist hypothesis to explain psychedelic experiences” based on the idea that psychotomimetic drugs cause brain desynchronization, processes labeled “brain entropy,” “complexity,” “diversity”—which Kastrup interprets as “very straightforward: brain <em>noise</em>.” The “entropic brain hypothesis” (9.5.6), Kastrup says, is “a linguistic charade,” leaving mainstream physicalism unsupported as a viable metaphysics of mind (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib436" name="bbib436" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib436"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2023</span></span></a>). (Neuropsychopharmacologist David Nutt contends that “we don't need to adopt an untestable metaphysical worldview to explain the subjective richness of psychedelic experiences” and that neuroscience and neuroimaging research have resources to develop complete theories—for example, chaotic cortical entropy may “release the usual brake” that the cortex holds on sub-cortical structures, especially the emotion centers, liberating the amygdala and hippocampus from “top-down” inhibitory control [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib585" name="bbib585" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib585"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Nutt, 2023</span></span></a>].

In other words, brain activity is what inner experience <em>looks like</em> when observed from the outside.” As such, he says, “the correlations ordinarily observed between patterns of brain activity and inner experience are due to the trivial fact that the appearance of a phenomenon correlates with the phenomenon.” And when this correlation is broken, as observed in the psychedelic state, the reason is that, “unlike a <em>cause</em>, the <em>appearance</em> of a phenomenon doesn't need to be always <em>complete</em>”<em>—</em>it can leave out much about the phenomenon it is an appearance of (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib436" name="bbib436" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib436"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6405">Kastrup maintains that idealism's key challenge is “to explain how the seemingly distinct phenomenal inner lives of different subjects of experience can arise within this fundamentally unitary phenomenal field.” This is called the “decomposition problem” and it is the core problem Kastrup needs to address. Other challenges include: “how to reconcile idealism with the fact that we all inhabit a common external world; why this world unfolds independently of our personal volition or imagination; why there are such tight correlations between measured patterns of brain activity and reports of experience” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib433" name="bbib433" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib433"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6410">Kastrup's unabashed challenge to his metaphysical competitors is that an idealist ontology “makes sense of reality in a more parsimonious and empirically rigorous manner than mainstream physicalism, bottom-up panpsychism, and cosmopsychism” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib432" name="bbib432" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib432"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2018</span></span></a>).

McGilchrist's relational, creative-process idealism</h3><p id="p6470">Psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and literary scholar Iain McGilchrist's idealist metaphysics has consciousness as “irreducible, primordial and omnipresent.” But consciousness is “not a thing; it is a creative process,” he says. “All that exists, exists in consciousness … consciousness is the stuff of the cosmos.” Moreover, given “that consciousness is ‘the fundamental given natural fact’, it clearly follows that it cannot be reduced to something more fundamental” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib526" name="bbib526" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib526"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2021b</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib525" name="bbib525" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib525"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2021a</span></span></a>, p. 1601).</p><p id="p6475">Matter, to McGilchrist, is “a theoretical abstraction that no one has seen.” The term clearly has meaning, he clarifies; “it refers to the qualities of certain elements within consciousness which offer <em>relative</em> resistance and <em>relative</em> permanence as a necessary part of that creative process” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib526" name="bbib526" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib526"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2021b</span></span></a>). Matter is also critical for individuality to arise.</p><p id="p6480">Put another way, McGilchrist has matter as “a special case, or a phase of consciousness.” Matter is not a separate thing, he says, any more than ice is separate from water; it's a phase of water; it's neither less nor more than water; it's not separate from water; it's a <em>kind</em> of water. And matter is a kind of consciousness—for a time—that has certain quite marked properties that are different from the way we normally think of consciousness, just as water is transparent and flows and all the rest, and ice is hard and opaque and can split your head open. So they're different but they're part of the same ontology.” McGilchrist stresses that “consciousness and matter must be <em>distinguished</em>”—but “there should be no need to set the one against the other.”</p><p id="p6485">McGilchrist's consciousness turns on its relational nature. He holds that “everything is relational, and that what we call things, the <em>relata</em>, are secondary to relationship.” Consciousness, he argues, is always “of” something, then he asks: “what is the nature then of that something that is both in part constitutive <em>of</em>, and in part constituted <em>by</em>, that relationship?”</p><p id="p6490">A consequence, counterintuitive to most, is that while some scientists consider a “Reality Out There” to be independent of any consciousness whatsoever—naïve realism—McGilchrist says, “In reality, we participate in the knowing: there is no ‘view from nowhere’” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib526" name="bbib526" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib526"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2021b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6495">Given that McGilchrist has consciousness as primordial and matter as a phase of consciousness, how does he have the relationship between the brain and consciousness? He says, “I do not suggest that the brain originates anything. I do not know that the brain ‘causes’ consciousness: it might or might not.” He goes on to note, rightly, “I know of no way of proving the point one way or the other, since the observable facts would look the same whether it [the brain] gave rise to, or simply mediated, consciousness.” In other words, the same findings are equally compatible with the brain <em>emitting</em> consciousness, <em>transmitting</em> consciousness, or <em>permitting</em> consciousness. (The latter two options are similar, except that <em>permitting</em> substitutes the idea of a constraint that is creative, fashioning what it allows to come into being, replacing the merely passive idea of <em>transmitting</em>.)” McGilchrist argues that “it is the last of these possibilities – <em>permitting</em> – that is the most convincing” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib525" name="bbib525" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib525"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2021a</span></span></a>, pp. 55, 1592).</p><p id="p6500">Logically, McGilchrist's ontology would skew to the brain alone not causing consciousness and his medical training would skew to the brain not being a mere passive receiver of consciousness. His solution seems to be something like this: the brain structures, shapes and physically actualizes the consciousness we experience so that it can be expressed and felt by a body.</p><p id="p6505">It's worth noting that McGilchrist's consciousness-matter ontology has a kind of relationship to his hemisphere hypothesis, which states that the brain's “two hemispheres have evolved so as to attend to the world, and therefore bring into being the only world we <em>can know</em>, in two largely opposing ways: the left hemisphere paying narrowly targeted attention to a detail that we need to manipulate; the right hemisphere paying broad, open, sustained, vigilant, uncommitted attention to the rest of the world while we focus on our desired detail” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib740" name="bbib740" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib740"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2009</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib525" name="bbib525" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib525"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2021a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6510">This means, he argues, that “each hemisphere brings into being a world that has different qualities … In the case of the left hemisphere, a world of <em>things</em> that are familiar, certain, fixed, isolated, explicit, abstracted from context, disembodied, general in nature, quantifiable, known by their parts, and inanimate. In the case of the right hemisphere, a world of <em>Gestalten</em>, forms and processes that are never reducible to the already known or certain, never accounted for by dissolution into parts, but always understood as wholes that both incorporate and are incorporated into other wholes, unique, always changing and flowing, interconnected, implicit, understood only in context, embodied and animate” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib524" name="bbib524" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib524"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2009</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib525" name="bbib525" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib525"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2021a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6515">Most importantly, the world of the right hemisphere is the world that <em>presences</em> to us, that of the left hemisphere a <em>re</em>-presentation: the left hemisphere a map, the right hemisphere the world of experience that is mapped.” To McGilchrist, loosely associating the right hemisphere with consciousness and the left hemisphere with matter may be more than metaphor.</p><p id="p6520">Finally, McGilchrist sees “the cosmos as fundamentally relational, and the ground of Being as driven to come to know itself in and through creating an evolving cosmos. The ground of Being and the cosmos respond to each other. (So far this is in keeping with Whitehead.) What life does is to increase by untold orders of magnitude the responsiveness of that cosmos. I, like Nagel, see that ‘value is not just an accidental side-effect of life; rather, there is life because life is a necessary condition of value.’” What life brings, McGilchrist maintains, “is not consciousness, then—which, as I have argued, is present from the beginning—but the coming into being of the capacity for value: thus, a mountain cannot value, though it can have value for creatures, like ourselves, who value. And it is not just we, but all living creatures, that for the first time are able to recognize value. Life vastly enhances the degree of responsiveness of, to and within the world.” Indeed, “life could be seen as the very process of the cosmic consciousness continually both discovering and furthering its beauty, truth, and goodness; both contemplating and (not separately but in the same indivisible act) further bringing them into being: a process” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib525" name="bbib525" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib525"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2021a</span></span></a>, pp. 1722, 1723).</p><p id="p6525">Yet, the grounding of consciousness is not deterministic, McGilchrist says. It has none of the characteristics of being pre-programmed by “an omnipotent and omniscient engineering God constructing and winding up a mechanism. It is in the process of discovering itself through its creative potential (one thing we all know directly from our own experience is that consciousness is endlessly creative)” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib525" name="bbib525" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib525"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGilchrist, 2021a</span></span></a>). The cosmos has purpose, McGilchrist says. “It has direction, but not direction of the hydraulic kind, being pushed blindly from behind, rather of the kind that is drawn from in front, by attractors that call it ever forward” (McGilchrist, personal communication).</p></section><section id="sec16.7"><h3 id="sectitle1005" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">16.7.

It is not, he says, that every phenomenon we can experience has consciousness or exhibits mind. It is that consciousness shapes itself into every mode of knowing and experiencing reality.” In other words, Chopra says, “the ‘hard problem’ isn't a problem at all.

Can quantum theory, as its adherents believe, open the door “to a profoundly new vision of the cosmos, where observer, observed, and the act of observation are interlocked,” thus hinting “at a science of wholeness, going beyond the purely physical emphasis of current science?” Adherents look to developments in the intersection of quantum theory, biology, neuroscience and the philosophy of mind. Non-local interactions of the quantum universe are cited as evidence of the interconnectedness of everything, supporting the idea that “consciousness and matter are not fundamentally distinct, but rather are two complementary aspects of one reality, embracing the micro and macro worlds,” ultimately founded on consciousness as the ultimate reality (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib426" name="bbib426" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib426"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kafatos et al., 2011</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6575">There are elaborate theories that claim to explain how consciousness, once assumed to be fundamental in nature and reality, generates or interacts with matter and energy and interfaces with the brain.

Consciousness, he says, “is the agency that collapses the wave of a quantum object, which exists in potentia, making it an immanent particle in the world of manifestation” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib315" name="bbib315" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib315"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Goswami, 1993</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib839" name="bbib839" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib839"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Woronko, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6585">Goswami sees Idealism as not only the most parsimonious theory of consciousness but also mitigating and perhaps solving the famous paradoxes of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, superposition and non-locality.</p><p id="p6590">The key, Goswami offers, is that there is only one consciousness in the universe, one subject of experience, in which we all (somehow) participate. The ego, he says “is constricted consciousness, much like a localized object. You cannot understand consciousness without experiencing expanded states of consciousness.”</p><p id="p6595">Consciousness, according to Goswami, plays an active role in constructing physical reality by “choosing” the results of a measurement. He views our mental activities, our thoughts and feelings, as “mental objects” in a sense similar to material objects, subject to the same laws of physics, particularly quantum mechanics. Thus, Goswami envisions the brain, not simply as a passive measuring device that intervenes in the quantum world, but more significantly as an active quantum system that selects and determines which unconscious processes become conscious. Goswami concludes that all creation is interconnected, including us (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib315" name="bbib315" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib315"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Goswami, 1993</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec16.10"><h3 id="sectitle1025" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">16.10. Spira's non-duality</h3><p id="p6600">Spiritual teacher (and pottery artist) Rupert Spira espouses non-duality as “the recognition that underlying the multiplicity and diversity of experience there is a single, infinite and indivisible reality, whose nature is pure consciousness from which all objects and selves derive their apparently independent existence.” He states, “The greatest discovery in life is that our essential nature does not share the limits or the destiny of the body and mind” (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib724" name="bbib724" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib724"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Spira, n.d.</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6605">To Spira, a non-dual understanding addresses two essential questions: one, “How may we be free of suffering and find the lasting peace and happiness for which all people long above all else?”, and two, “What is the nature of reality?” While the first is most meaningful to individuals and to the global community, only the second is relevant for this Landscape.</p><p id="p6610">Spira begins his non-dual teaching with an investigation into the essential nature of our self, and it is this “clear knowledge of oneself,” he says, that is also the basis of the second aspect of the non-dual understanding, “namely, the recognition that reality is an infinite, indivisible whole, made of pure consciousness, from which all separate objects and selves borrow their apparently independent existence.” Everything we know or experience, he states, “is mediated through the mind, and therefore, the mind's knowledge of anything can only ever be as good as its knowledge of itself. In order to know what anything truly is—that is, what reality truly is—the mind must first know its own essential nature. Therefore, the investigation into the nature of the mind must be the highest endeavor upon which any mind can embark, and the knowledge of its essence or nature the highest knowledge.”</p><p id="p6615">Spira suggests that approaching non-duality as a means of finding an answer to the ultimate question about the nature of reality “is found at the heart of all the great religious and spiritual traditions.” For instance, “In Christianity, it is said, ‘I and my Father are one’. That is, the essence of our self and the ultimate reality of the universe are the same.” Similarly, “in the Sufi tradition, ‘Whosoever knows their self knows their Lord’. That is, whoever knows the essential nature of their self knows the ultimate reality of the universe.” And “in Buddhism, ‘Samsara and Nirvana are one’, meaning the nature of the world and the essence of the mind are identical” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib724" name="bbib724" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib724"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Spira, n.d.</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec16.11"><h3 id="sectitle1030" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">16.11.

It's a fundamental, philosophical divide, he says, and from his perspective, he begins from consciousness, puts consciousness first, because “this is where all knowledge starts … your starting point is perception, a set of perceptions, a set of concepts. And from that, you build up a picture of what the world is like” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib826" name="bbib826" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib826"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ward, 2006</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6665">Ward stresses “you can never get rid of consciousness.” He is firm: “From where I sit, I can just say whatever view you come up with, consciousness is not reducible to particles which are publicly observable in space and time.” He is adamant: “I will just not give way on this—because it seems to me so obvious; I don't see how anyone can deny it.” Responding to questions about the putative illusion of conscious unity, Ward is dismissive (politely): “You're inventing a problem.”</p><p id="p6670">Ward's idealism surfaces when contrasting dualism. His claim, even for explaining Descartes, is not that mind and body/brain are separate substances that must somehow interact, but rather are subject and object, the thinker and perceiver as the subject who is aware of its perceptions and which is engaged in having its thoughts. “What you've got is a subject thinking. The subject is not a different substance.”</p><p id="p6675">Ward then rationalizes his idealism. “The whole world is actually a construct with perceptions and feelings and thoughts. But the agent who is having these perceptions, the perceiver, the thinker, is not another thing somewhere. So, subjects and objects are always together. There's no subject without an object. There's no mind without some objectivity, some environment in which it's embodied. That's why I see embodiment as an essential part of mentality, and of being a person. When you're talking about the mind, you're talking about a subject, an embodied subject, who nevertheless is not to be identified simply by physical facts which are publicly observable. I think that's what the soul is: An embodied subject of intellectual and moral agency” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib826" name="bbib826" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib826"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Ward, 2006</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec16.13"><h3 id="sectitle1040" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">16.13.

She faces the “vicious dilemma” of subjects arising from unconditioned consciousness. “If the manifest world of subjects is real, it irrevocably undercuts the purely unconditioned nature of the ground by imposing boundaries between subjects and the ground. If only the ground is real, we have the seemingly absurd consequence of denying reality to what seems undeniably existent.” She finds resources in the modern mystic, Sri Ramana Maharshi, who was recorded as saying, “Nothing exists except the one reality … The one unity alone exists ever. To such as find it difficult to grasp this truth and who ask, ‘How can we ignore this solid world we see all around us?’ the dream experience is pointed out and they are told, ‘All that you see depends on the seer. Apart from the seer, there is no seen.’” (Ramana is expressing what is known in Advaita Vedanta as the ajāta doctrine, which means “not created, not caused”.)

Other names for the UKF, he says, include Universal Consciousness, Cosmic Consciousness, Universal Mind, Universal Memory, Universal Intelligence, Holographic Memory, Collective Consciousness, Implicate Order and the Plenum. The UKF is said to be consistent with fundamental physics, cosmological and holographic models.

This provides a conceptual bridge between living and non-living systems, relevant for biophysics, brain research, and biological evolution. He proposes that the pro-life EMF frequency bands may literally act in concert as a “tonal octave-based symphony” to provide living systems, including the brain, with information embedded in such harmonic-like resonance patterns. Such “tonal” projections, in a global manner, may organize synchronicity, both spatially and temporally in essential organs in the body: heart and brain (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib537" name="bbib537" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib537"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Meijer et al, 2020</span></span></a>, pp. 1–31).</p><p id="p6705">Thus, if nature is guided by “a discrete pattern of harmonic solitonic waves,” since the whole human organism, including brain, is embedded in this dynamic energy field, a comprehensive model for human (self-) consciousness could be conceived.

According to FBI, observer/participants, who are individuations of this consciousness, detect patterns in a facet of consciousness called the “Urgrund”—the fundamental essence of existence—and shape this information into frames of experience by translating complex signal patterns into qualia. One hallmark of FBI is that the generation of experiential frames by consciousness creates the arrow of time. Its observer-based viewpoint of reality aligns with quantum mechanics, such that wave-particle duality and entanglement (“spooky action at a distance”) are no longer odd or mysterious. FBI distinguishes itself from other forms of idealism by asserting that conscious agents primarily interact with one another through the intermediary of the Urgrund in a kind of question-and-answer game and by proposing that spacetime is a set of rules that consciousness needs to adhere to when creating experiential frames to allow for the experienced world to be consistent.

Neuroscientist Pablo Rodriguez posits that the brain can generate only c-patterns, no experiences, because experiences are qualitatively different from matter. Experiences are thus regarded as created by the universe, in that c-patterns are constantly “read” and converted to experiences. C-Pattern Theory has three basic points. First, the brain doesn't generate conscious experiences; it generates c-patterns, which are complex geometric three-dimensional structures composed of all action potentials from all of the brain's [relevant] neurons firing at any given moment. The c-pattern's specific form and geometry is postulated as being what fully defines any conscious experience. So, for every moment, there's a different c-pattern and a corresponding experience defined by it. Second, an experience is defined by a c-pattern's form, but each is created by the universe, not by the brain; rather, a c-pattern's specific form and geometry encodes an experience as a discrete expressions of a universal geometric experience language, which the universe understands perfectly and decodes into real, actual experiences. Third, we are not body and brain; we are consciousness. If c-patterns are mere symbols converted to experiences, then only consciousness can be what's having all experiences. And as we are the ones experiencing, we are parts of consciousness. Different organisms have different c-patterns, experiences, and levels of understanding reality. So, this world is just what our c-patterns currently allow, until we manage to expand them to the next level. Thus, true human progress is possible only if the experience language is deciphered and c-patterns are expanded towards greater understanding (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib653" name="bbib653" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib653"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Rodriguez, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6740"><u>The Meaning of Life</u>.

The sense of self just emerges out of the process of alternating “awareness” and “awareness of awareness.” This view on consciousness comes from an interpretation of “non-self” in Buddhism. Conversely, it also provides insight into consciousness-only and <em>anatta</em> (from “non-self” to “emptiness”) in Buddhism: in reality, there is neither subject nor object of “awareness” (or “consciousness”). According to Yogācāra, there is no object of awareness (or consciousness). Therefore, the mystery behind “consciousness-only” should be how consciousness arises. However, according to Madhyamaka, there is even no consciousness and everything is empty (Huang, n.d.).</p><p id="p6755"><u>Consciousness's Platonic Computation</u>.

Consciousness is pervasive, connecting to God via “devotional nonduality” and enabling, at its higher levels, a beneficial and healing effect on the world.

Charles Tart, whose book, <em>Altered States of Consciousness,</em> was the first comprehensive treatment of the subject, focuses on the subjective nature of the experience: "Altered states of consciousness are alternate patterns or configurations of experience, which differ qualitatively from a baseline state," stressing “… such that the experiencer feels his consciousness is radically different from the way it functions ordinarily” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib767" name="bbib767" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib767"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1969</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6845">Note that Anomalous and Altered States theories, strictly speaking, are generally not theories of consciousness per se in that they are not theories of what consciousness <em>is</em>.

It is natural that those who interpret psi results favorably are also motivated to accept (or to create) non-local theories of consciousness. Moreover, while advocates of Anomalous and Altered States theories skew toward dualist or idealist theories, they espouse all the non-materialist theories: quantum, panpsychism and monism as well as dualism and idealism. For example, Dean Radin supports a “quantum oriented,” non-substance dualism (17.3), while Charles Tart supports an “emergent interactionism” substance dualism (17.4).

In consciousness, he says, “we find succeeding states without distinction; and, in space, simultaneities which, without succeeding, are distinguished, in the sense that one is no longer there when the other one appears.

There is no hidden power in matter; matter is only images.” He critiques materialism by “showing that matter does not differ in nature from representation … the image is less than a thing but more than a representation” Moreover, Bergson's theory of “pure perception” posits that how we know things, in their pure states, is representational, thus establishing a middle ground between realism and idealism (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib486" name="bbib486" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib486"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lawlor and Moulard-Leonard, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6865">To Bergson, “That which perceives is consciousness, that is to say <em>the memory taken as a whole</em> because this consciousness, which we might call here human soul or human spirit, is a <em>continuous movement</em> between pure perception and pure memory.” “The brain does not perceive: it <em>transmits</em> perception (pure or not) from the organ of perception to consciousness (<em>sensory</em> mechanism) and, conversely, it <em>transmits</em> the nascent order of action from consciousness to the appropriate motor organ to act in response to perception (<em>motor</em> mechanism) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib43" name="bbib43" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib43"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bergson, 1896</span></span></a>, 1990; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib601" name="bbib601" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib601"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Pascal, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6870">Continuing, Bergson puts memory at the heart of consciousness with pithy propositions. “Mind with memory is consciousness and produces time. Mind without memory is the unconscious and produces space.” “The phenomena of memory are at the juncture of consciousness and matter.” “Going from pure perception to memory, we definitively leave matter behind for the mind.” “First the present becomes past and <em>then</em> the past becomes present. Thus, consciousness becomes <em>the bridge</em> between the present and the past which we call <em>the future</em>.

Our capacity to focus and act in the world is enabled by our brain acting as barrier, shielding our personal awareness from the vast cacophony swirling in the great beyond (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib44" name="bbib44" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib44"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bergson, 1920</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6880">Bergson's notion of consciousness is “a ceaselessly dynamic, inherently temporal substance of reality” that might even allow for some sort of survival after death (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib34" name="bbib34" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib34"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Barnard, 2011</span></span></a>).

But one can revisit Henri Bergson to find a lucid dose of common sense: ‘That there is a close connection between a state of consciousness and the brain we do not dispute. But there is also a close connection between a coat and the nail on which it hangs, for, if the nail is pulled out, the coat falls to the ground. Shall we say, then, that the shape of the nail gives us the shape of the coat, or in any way corresponds to it?’ What do brain data really show?

Prime features of the collective unconscious, according to Jung, are “archetypes” and “synchronicity:” archetypes are ancient primal symbols, themes and images that are apparently universal and recurring and can impact individual psyches; and synchronicity describes putative connections between physical and/or mental events that are acausal and seemingly random but appear to be meaningfully related.</p><p id="p6900">Synchronicity is properly controversial, because, according to the laws of physics, there should be nothing of the sort. But if, perchance, synchronicity does exist and it does represent real phenomena—if synchronous events are not mere chance masquerading as meaning—then synchronicity would be a powerful probe of novel fundamental realities of mind and world, and it would, en passant, take down classic materialism.<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn61" name="bfn61" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn61"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>61</sup></span></span></a></p><p id="p6905">Jung had been intrigued by the ancient Chinese oracle <em>I Ching</em>, whose 64 hexagram symbols generated divinations “made by seemingly random numerical happenings for which the <em>I Ching</em> text gives detailed situational analysis.” Years later, Jung introduced synchronicity "to describe circumstances that appear meaningfully related yet lack a causal connection." Other definitions Jung used enriched synchronicity's non-normal vision of reality: "a hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation," "an acausal connecting principle," "acausal parallelism," and the "meaningful coincidence of two or more events where something other than the probability of chance is involved” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib755" name="bbib755" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib755"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Synchronicity, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6910">Collaborating with physicist and Nobel laureate Wolfgang Pauli (Pauli Exclusion Principle), Jung further developed the radical concept. Pauli contributed his intimate understanding of the common sense-defying elements of quantum theory, such as complementarity, nonlocality, and the observer effect, and their work together yielded what is now called the “Pauli–Jung conjecture”—which stands for “a basic psychophysically neutral reality with its derivative mental and physical aspects and the nature of the correlations that connect these aspects.” Jung and Pauli "offered the radical and brilliant idea that the currency of these [synchronicity's] correlations is not (quantitative) statistics, as in quantum physics, but (qualitative) meaning” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib21" name="bbib21" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib21"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib22" name="bbib22" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib22"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher and Fuchs, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6915">For his part, Pauli said that synchronicities were "corrections to chance fluctuations by meaningful and purposeful coincidences of causally unconnected events," though he sought to move away from “coincidence” and towards a "correspondence," "connection," or "constellation" of discrete factors. Jung's and Pauli's position was that, “just as causal connections can provide a meaningful understanding of the psyche and the world, so too may acausal connections” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib755" name="bbib755" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib755"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Synchronicity, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6920">The speculative nexus between synchronicity and quantum physics turns on entanglement, where there is absolute correlation but absolutely no transference of information. Thus, quantum entanglement is said to be the physical phenomenon that most closely represents the concept of synchronicity. As Harald Atmanspacher puts it. “Inspired by and analogous to entanglement-induced nonlocal correlations in quantum physics, mind-matter entanglement is conceived as the hypothetical origin of mind-matter correlations. This exhibits the highly speculative picture of a fundamentally holistic, psychophysically neutral level of reality from which correlated mental and material domains emerge” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6925">Atmanspacher probes for epistemic/ontic commonalities between synchronicity and entanglement. He highlights “local realism” of empirical facts obtained from classical measuring instruments and a “holistic realism” of entangled systems, arguing that “these domains are connected by the process of measurement, thus far conceived as independent of conscious observers. The corresponding picture on the mental side refers to a distinction between conscious and unconscious domains” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6930">A further claim concerns Jung's “depth psychology” conceptions, where these two domains of local realism and holistic realism are connected by the emergence of conscious mental states from the unconscious, analogous apparently to physical measurement. Crucially, famously, “Jung's unconscious has a collective component, unseparated between individuals and populated by so-called archetypes.” These archetypes are said to be “constituting the psychophysically neutral level comprising both the collective unconscious and the holistic reality of quantum theory.” At the same time, Atmanspacher says, “they operate as ‘ordering factors’, being responsible for the arrangement of their psychical and physical manifestations in the epistemically distinguished domains of mind and matter” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib20" name="bbib20" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib20"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Atmanspacher, 2020a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6935">So, here's the axial question: Does the “acausal connection principle” in synchronicity meaningfully parallel the “acausal correlation principle” in quantum entanglement? Is this apparent parallelism revelatory or shoehorn forced, unveiling profound new realities, or overthinking superficial similarities? Again, the axial question.</p><p id="p6940">Why have I situated Jung's collective unconscious on this Landscape of Consciousness? The reason is somewhat indirect, because, if valid as stated, a literal collective unconscious would falsify many theories of consciousness, certainly defeat every strictly materialistic theory. Moreover, it would be consistent with diverse nonphysical theories: Dualism, Panpsychism, and Idealism. Idealism is most often associated with Jung's worldview.</p><p id="p6945">While Jung is recognized as one of the most important psychologists in history, few scientists take his concept of the collective unconscious as literally true. However, Jung's highlighting (and coining) synchronicity does elicit from time to time far-reaching theories in both physics and consciousness regarding anomalous cognition and events.</p></section><section id="sec17.3"><h3 id="sectitle1070" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.3. Radin's challenge to materialism</h3><p id="p6950">Coming at consciousness from an empirical point of view, parapsychologist Dean Radin calls on what he believes to be the overwhelming evidence for psi phenomena in order to infer that “intention affects the physical world.” He characterizes his work as “a tiny part of a century-long legacy of researchers who have reported studies, when meta-analyzed, provide strong evidence for psi” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib637" name="bbib637" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib637"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Radin, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6955">Radin notes that non-local conscious experiences are commonly reported (prevalence rates well above 10% and as high as 90%). Moreover, cognitive abilities can be retained when the brain is seriously compromised. For example, in terminal lucidity patients with terminal neurodegenerative conditions can display apparently normal cognitive function and mental clarity during the short period preceding death; paradoxical lucidity can occur in dementia due to advanced Alzheimer's disease, brain abscesses, tumors, strokes, and meningitis.<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn62" name="bfn62" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn62"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>62</sup></span></span></a></p><p id="p6960">Radin recruits the happy term “magic,” as in “real magic,” to facilitate public appreciation that psi/paranormal phenomena are a natural aspect of reality (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib638" name="bbib638" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib638"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Radin, 2018</span></span></a>), and he claims strong experimental or empirical evidence for three types of “real magic:” (i) “divination,” which in today's world is perceiving through space and time and which is identical to clairvoyance, remote viewing, precognition; (ii) “force of will,” which causes “psycho-kinetic effects,” the idea that your mindful intention can affect aspects of the physical world beyond yourself; and (iii) “theurgy,” by which Radin means the practice of engaging or communicating with spirits, entities that are not human and invisible to most people (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib636" name="bbib636" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib636"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Radin, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6965">Then, Radin says, you start thinking like a scientist and ask how could these phenomena happen? “Well, what are the ‘force beams’ coming out of the head? But we don't see any beams coming out. In fact, even the evidence doesn't exactly look like it's a causal mechanism. These are weird relationships that arise.” Next, Radin says, is to consider some kind of “downward causation” effect. I suppose that's possible, he says, “but it just seems to make more sense if really at the bottom is simply consciousness. There's some kind of ‘ocean of consciousness’ that gives rise to an emergent property, which we may call energy, which gives rise to matter, and then the physical world plays out in a way that we usually see it, except that really at the bottom is consciousness.” It's much, much easier, Radin says, “to simply imagine that matter is ultimately composed of mind, that mind and matter are ultimately the same thing, than to imagine the complex mechanisms of mind-body/brain interactions” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib637" name="bbib637" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib637"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Radin, 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6970">Radin and colleagues point to specific non-local effects to support their proposal that “post-materialistic models of consciousness may be required to break the conceptual impasse presented by the hard problem of consciousness.” They review several alternative non-physicalist theories: all of which purport to refute the central premise of physicalist theories that consciousness is generated solely and purely by the brain and is only local to the brain. Most of these theories have quantum or panpsychism pedigrees; some even propose that consciousness is more fundamental than energy-matter and spacetime (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib822" name="bbib822" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib822"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wahbeh et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6975">Radin and colleagues propose that “consciousness may not originate in the brain,” although many aspects of human consciousness are obviously dependent on the brain. They also suggest that awareness too extends beyond the brain. While they affirm with conviction that these non-physical, non-local properties of consciousness are observable, they are less confident as to the underlying mechanism of how they work. It may be, they say “due to a non-local material effect, to consciousness being fundamental, or something else we have not yet discovered” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib822" name="bbib822" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib822"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wahbeh et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6980">Thus, Radin and colleagues propose “specific phenomena that we would expect to see if non-local consciousness theories are correct:” Perceiving information about distant locations (clairvoyance, including remote viewing); perceiving information from another person (telepathy); perceiving the future (precognition); and apparent cognitive abilities beyond the experience/learning/skill of the person exhibiting them (e.g., speaking a foreign language they do not know, i.e., speaking “in tongues”) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib822" name="bbib822" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib822"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wahbeh et al., 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6985">In defending their quantum-oriented approach to the mind-brain problem, Stuart Kauffman and Radin cite as evidence for a nonlocal mind the predictions of two types of nonlocal experiences: “The mind would have the capacity to extend beyond the mind-brain system, and the act of observing a distant physical system would, to some degree, directly influence the behavior of that system.” Such effects, they claim, would occasionally result in experiences “where minds interact with other minds, where minds perceive hidden or distant objects or events, and where minds directly influence aspects of the physical world” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib441" name="bbib441" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib441"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kauffman and Radin, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6990">The common terms for these psi phenomena are the following: “<em>telepathy</em> for mind-to-mind interactions; <em>clairvoyance</em> for perceptions of inanimate things across space; <em>precognition</em> for perceptions through time; and <em>psychokinesis</em> for mental influence of physical objects.” Kauffman and Radin stress that use of these different terms does not imply that the underlying phenomena are different in kind; “they are just labels used to describe the way the experiences seem to manifest” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib441" name="bbib441" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib441"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kauffman and Radin, 2020</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p6995">While Radin's primary line of argument uses psi phenomena to corroborate a nonlocal mind of a quantum-oriented nature, one can reverse the causal-explanatory direction such that a nonlocal mind could provide a mechanism for psi phenomena (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib441" name="bbib441" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib441"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kauffman and Radin, 2020</span></span></a>).

Tart's emergent interactionism</h3><p id="p7000">Consciousness explorer Charles Tart proposes “Emergent Interactionism” as a dualistic theory of consciousness, based on his long work on altered states of consciousness, transpersonal psychology, and multiple forms of parapsychology (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib768" name="bbib768" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib768"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1978a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib771" name="bbib771" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib771"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2007</span></span></a>). He calls it “pragmatic dualism,” in that it reflects the nature of things and recognizes the need to understand consciousness in terms of two qualitatively different aspects of reality: a “B system” of brain and body governed by physical law, and a “M/L system” of the mental and life aspects of reality.</p><p id="p7005">Consciousness, Tart says, is a “system property,” an emergent from the auto-psi interaction of the B and M/L systems. Ultimate understanding of consciousness, then, in addition to conventional neuroscience, also requires increasing knowledge of psi/paranormal phenomena.</p><p id="p7010">Tart claims that the veracity of psi phenomena is a clear-cut scientific demonstration of the inadequacy of a materialistic view of mind and matter. The “psychoneural identity hypothesis,” he says, is so widely accepted in science and so thoroughly discredited by ESP and parapsychology (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib768" name="bbib768" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib768"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1978a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7015">Tart's extraordinary hypothesis is that psi is being used much of the time in everyone's life, but it is being used <em>internally</em>. This means, he offers, we frequently use auto-clairvoyance to read our own B system and auto-psychokinesis to affect our B systems. This is ordinary psi, auto-psi. What we observe in parapsychological experiments, however, is non-ordinary psi, which is taking a process ordinarily confined within a single organism and pushing it outside, making it “allo-psi” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib768" name="bbib768" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib768"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1978a</span></span></a>, personal communication).</p><p id="p7020">The Emergent Interactionist position allows for kinds of potential survival beyond bodily death, Tart speculates, but it would not necessarily be the kind of postmortem survival we usually conceive of. Our usual imagery of survival means survival of the basic pattern of our consciousness, our experience of our mental life, our feelings of personal identity. But if consciousness, as Tart proposes, is an emergent of the auto-psi interactions of the B and the M/L systems, an emergent of constant patterning of each system upon the other, then if the B system ceases functioning in death, the patterning influence of the B system upon the M/L system will cease, so how is ordinary consciousness, as we know it, to survive? What is the emergent to emerge from?</p><p id="p7025">One answer, according to Tart—and not the pleasant answer people would like—may be that personal identity, which is so intimately intertwined with ordinary consciousness, does not survive death, at least not for very long, and in any event it would likely be quite different from the original person (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib768" name="bbib768" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib768"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1978a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7030">Moreover, Tart stresses, psi phenomena radicalize even further the nonphysical dimension of dualism by showing how consciousness reveals or enables space and time to be flexible and mobile. He proposes that an extended aspect of the mind, which is activated when psi abilities are used, has two properties that differ from our ordinary consciousness. The first is that psi-engaged consciousness is not spatially or temporally localized with respect to ordinary spatial and temporal constraints on the physical body/brain, and so somehow can pick up information at spatial locations outside the sensory range of the body/brain (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib769" name="bbib769" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib769"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1978b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7035">The second property of psi-engaged consciousness is that the center point of its experienced present can be located at a different temporal location than the center point of the experienced present of ordinary consciousness. That is, it may be centered around a time that, by ordinary standards, is past or future. Furthermore, the duration of this extended dimension of the mind's experienced present is wider than that of our ordinarily experienced present, such that the mind may include portions of time that, from our ordinary point of view, are both past and future as well as present (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib768" name="bbib768" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib768"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tart, 1978a</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec17.5"><h3 id="sectitle1080" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.5. Josephson's psi-informed models</h3><p id="p7040">Nobel laureate physicist Brian Josephson approaches consciousness from the dual perspectives of fundamental science and psi phenomena. He posits understanding the brain by “implementing the demands of an appropriate collection of models, each concerned with some aspect of brain and behaviour”—in particular, explaining “higher-level properties [e.g., phenomenology] in terms of lower-level ones by means of a series of inferences based on these models” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib419" name="bbib419" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib419"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Josephson, 2004</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7045">Josephson says that many scientists believe that psi is real but don't come out and say so due to social pressures and career concerns. He considers the immense implications if, say, telepathy exists. “All sorts of things would change if we accepted that paranormal things happen and that we have such connections.” One simple example is playing music in an ensemble, where, using telepathy, “they somehow lock into a single state and perform better” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib420" name="bbib420" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib420"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Josephson, 2012a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7050">As for how psi could work, Josephson posits quantum physics—Einstein's “spooky actions at a distance”—but also recognizes that “we probably need to include new dimensions of reality.” He points to biology, the emergence of life, as a “strange phenomenon” that “changes the whole game.” Biology, he says, “involves principles that we don't have in physics, and these principles might be able to unfold in quite dramatic ways, extending our understanding of the cosmos, perhaps because biological principles lead to minds and minds can do things.”</p><p id="p7055">Josephson sees biology and consciousness as fundamentally linked because “organisms deal with information in a certain way and consciousness could fit into that.” There could be some kind of “biological field,” analogous to the electric field, he says. The assumption that you can get to some ultimate level, though, “may be incorrect.”</p><p id="p7060">Josephson's “theory of everything” paradigm, informed by psi and based on “parallels between spontaneously fluctuating equilibrium states and life processes,” envisions “an evolving ensemble of experts [modules], each with its own goals but nevertheless acting in harmony with each other.” How such an ensemble might function and evolve, he says, can affect fundamental physics such as symmetry and symmetry breaking. Josephson says, “This picture differs from that of regular physics in that goal-directedness has an important role to play, contrasting with that of the conventional view which implies a meaningless universe” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib423" name="bbib423" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib423"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Josephson, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7065">Moreover, advancing John Wheeler's proposal that “repeated acts of observation give rise to the reality that we observe,” Josephson suggests that “nature has a deep technological aspect that evolves as a result of selection processes that act upon observers making use of the technologies.” He concludes that “our universe is the product of agencies that use these evolved technologies to suit particular purposes” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib422" name="bbib422" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib422"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Josephson, 2015</span></span></a>).

Integral Theory is founded on a developmental “spectrum of consciousness,” an evolutionary account from ancient non-life-to-life proto-consciousness to ultimate spirit/spiritual attainment or enlightenment. In New-Age intellectual circles, Integral Theory is lauded as a pioneering, path-setting model for novel explorations of consciousness and human futures (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib394" name="bbib394" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib394"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Integral Theory/WIlber, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7075">Wilber's core framework is a four-quadrant model—the AQAL (All Quadrants All Levels) model—the simple-sounding 2x2 grid arraying interior-exterior with individual-collective. The ambitious claim is that all essential theories, models and levels of individual psychology and spiritual development, and of collective expressions of social organization, can be subsumed and discerned within Wilber's AQAL system.

Founded on the emergence of mind and the evolution of human consciousness, and on combatting philosophical naturalism (which he considers as a source of the world's ills), Wilber asks a critical question: Can spiritual concerns be integrated with the modern world? Wilber conceives of the “Kosmos” (not “cosmos,” which is too physicalist for him) as consisting of several concentric spheres: matter (the physical universe); then life (the vital realm); then mind (the mental realm); then soul (the psychic realm); and then finally Spirit (the spiritual realm) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib833" name="bbib833" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib833"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wilber, 1995</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7085">In his 1999 book, <em>Integral Psychology: Consciousness, Spirit, Psychology, Therapy</em>, Wilber seeks to reestablish spiritual consciousness in contemporary developmental psychology by embracing “every legitimate aspect of human consciousness [Eastern and Western, ancient and modern] under one roof.” Wilber's project is to legitimatize, within the framework of modern science, the spiritual quest (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib834" name="bbib834" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib834"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Wilber, 1999</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7090">What's the relationship between Wilber's project and this Landscape of theories of (phenomenal) consciousness?

Combs's chaotic attractor and autopoietic systems</h3><p id="p7095">Consciousness researcher and systems theorist Allan Combs uses nonlinear dynamics, and more specifically chaos theory, to understand how all the elements of conscious experience “cling together to form the many states and structures of consciousness that characterize the onflow of our experiential lives.” (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib170" name="bbib170" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib170"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Combs, 2022</span></span></a>). In doing so, Combs channels William James, “This multitude of ideas, existing absolutely, yet clinging together, and weaving an endless carpet of themselves, …like dominoes in ceaseless change, or the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope—whence do they get their fantastic laws of clinging, and why do they cling in just the shapes they do?” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib407" name="bbib407" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib407"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 1890</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7100">“We live in a nonlinear universe,” Combs says, which means that “nothing turns out exactly as one might expect based on projections from the past.” While this is true in physics and astronomy, it is “even more true in the realms of biological systems and the mind.” What results is “the emergence of novel interacting elements,” which is “an essential feature of countless real-world events.” Moreover, in chaotic systems, like the weather, while there are recognizable general patterns, “it is impossible to make precise predictions about future behavior”—local or moment-to-moment details are always unpredictable.</p><p id="p7105">The action of chaotic systems can be mapped topologically as <em>attractors</em>, that is, as recognizable mathematical patterns that repeat or almost repeat themselves indefinitely. But systems that can be represented as chaotic attractors never repeat themselves precisely. “Many complex systems of a biological nature, such as the metabolic rhythms of a living cell, EEG responses to sensory stimuli, and circadian sleep cycles, are in a strict sense always novel. That is, they are never exactly the same twice.” Even the action of a healthy human heart shows variation from beat to beat (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib170" name="bbib170" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib170"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Combs, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7110">According to Combs, consciousness, the onflow of experience, “fits the bill nicely as a chaotic-like attractor.” To begin with, it is always in motion, dynamic and ever-changing. Moreover, like all chaotic attractors, it displays a recognizable pattern; yet, it is never exactly the same during different cycles. Indeed, this unique feature of each person's onflow of experience is what James considered to be the basic signature of an individual personality. “Each of us, for instance, experiences unique patterns of thoughts, feelings, perceptions, memories, and so on, that replay in roughly the same way day in and day out.” But never precisely the same. Thus, consciousness as a chaotic attractor is ever-changing yet identifiable, “in a fashion that amounts to a distinct signature of the individual's experiential life.”</p><p id="p7115">Combs recruits the concept of “autopoiesis” to help explain consciousness. Autopoiesis means capable of generating and maintaining itself by producing its own parts—“auto” meaning "self" and “poiesis” meaning "creation” or “production” (Humberto and Varela, 1980)—a concept applied widely in understanding biological systems, such as the self-maintaining biochemistry of living cells.</p><p id="p7120">Assuming consciousness, as James had it, is “the onflow of thoughts, memories, and emotions that recreate themselves as they go along, ‘clinging together, and weaving an endless carpet of themselves’ … [then] this description fits the notion of a chaotic autopoietic attractor.” For example, Combs cites how “joy, anger, and sadness tend to sustain themselves by creating their own self-perpetuating internal conditions.” Emotional states self-propagate, he says, “thereby creating coherent self-organizing streams of experience,” with each such state accompanied by its own neurochemistry, which also contributes to its resilience (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib170" name="bbib170" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib170"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Combs, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7125">In addition, cognitive patterns by which we understand the world exemplify the mind as a complex, self-creating autopoietic system. The mind also exhibits features of a chaotic system on the “edge of chaos” or “the brink of change,” characterized by “periods of relative stability punctuated by phases of instability, or increased chaotic behavior, after which they may return to their original state, or transition (bifurcate) to a new attractor pattern” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib170" name="bbib170" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib170"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Combs, 2022</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec17.8"><h3 id="sectitle1095" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.8. Schooler's resonance theory and subjective time</h3><p id="p7130">Experimental psychologist Jonathan Schooler outlines a theory of consciousness that combines two novel ideas: “resonance theory,” where multiple levels of consciousness interact, and “subjective time,” where consciousness arises with an observer's movement through objective time relative to a currently unacknowledged dimension of subjective time (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib678" name="bbib678" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib678"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022a</span></span></a>). Both ideas are motivated by Schooler's research and thinking on meta-consciousness, mind wandering, and anomalous cognition (i.e., psi/paranormal phenomena).</p><p id="p7135">The first idea is what he calls meta-consciousness or meta-awareness. In addition to having experiences, he says, “periodically, I check-in on what's going on in my mind. And I may notice things that I hadn't noticed otherwise; for example, mind wandering while reading. We all have the experience of reading along and suddenly realizing that, although our eyes are moving across the page, we have no idea what we're reading. We're thinking about something completely unrelated. It's as if we're waking up, but we were awake all along” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib678" name="bbib678" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib678"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022a</span></span></a>). Temporal dissociations are revealed when an individual, who previously lacked meta-consciousness about the contents of consciousness, directs meta-consciousness towards those contents (e.g., catching one's mind wandering during reading) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib676" name="bbib676" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib676"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2002</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7140">Appreciating the distinction between consciousness and meta-consciousness helps to clarify a variety of phenomenal experiences. As Schooler notes, “when we're entering a moment of meta-consciousness, when we recognize that we can have experience without being meta-aware of that experience, it helps to open up the discussion about consciousness. We can have an emotion and not realize that we're having it. We may not notice that we're angry. When people shout, ‘I'm not angry,’ they are attempting to take stock of it, but they get it wrong. By recognizing this distinction between experiential consciousness and meta-consciousness we can gain broader perspectives on the varieties of consciousness and deeper understanding of the nature of consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib678" name="bbib678" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib678"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7145">Meta-consciousness is said to correspond to conscious states in which the content of those states includes an explicit characterization of what is currently being experienced. In other words, he says, meta-consciousness is simply a kind of conscious experience in which the focus of thought is turned on to itself. Thus, although conscious and unconscious mental processes are categorically distinct, conscious and meta-conscious states differ only with respect to the type of content that they entail (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib681" name="bbib681" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib681"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler and Mrazek, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7150">“Resonance theory” leverages meta-consciousness by positing multiple levels or streams of consciousness going on simultaneously. In the same way that the brain's left and right hemispheres seem to carry on multiple streams of consciousness, Schooler says it's possible that lower levels or “windows” may have their own, albeit circumscribed conscious experiences. And the way that these windows are communicating with one another is through resonances of assorted kinds. Within a single window, all can be happening in synchrony, and then, between levels, there is cross-frequency coupling. And it is through these various kinds of resonances, both top-down and bottom-up circuits, that multiple potentially sentient windows may be able to communicate with one another, thus producing what we know as macroscopic consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib678" name="bbib678" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib678"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7155">According to Schooler, the resonance theory of consciousness works via a shared resonance that allows different parts of the brain to achieve a phase transition in the speed and bandwidth of information flows between the constituent parts. This phase transition allows for richer varieties of consciousness to arise, with the character and content of that consciousness in each moment determined by the particular set of constituent neurons (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib390" name="bbib390" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib390"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hunt and Schooler, 2019</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7160">Schooler recognizes that because the idea driving his resonance theory is that we may have multiple levels of consciousness, he affirms what Daniel Dennett denies: a “Cartesian Theater” in the brain. Whereas Dennett disparages the “Cartesian Theater” as imaginary, Schooler champions its reality.</p><p id="p7165">“I do think that, at any given moment, there is a vantage,” Schooler states, “but I also think that it's just one of multiple vantages that are happening in the mind. We have multiple windows; we have what we call ‘nested observer windows’. And so, we imagine that consciousness may actually be these nested windows, windows upon windows, with each one resonating with the others. In this way, through the shared resonance between different windows, at different levels of awareness, we may construct an ever increasingly complex conscious experience.” Thus, Schooler conjectures that there may be not just a single Cartesian Theater, but in fact a “Cartesian Multiplex” of multiple nested observers (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib678" name="bbib678" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib678"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7170">The second idea undergirding Schooler's theory of consciousness is the real possibility of “anomalous cognition” (i.e., psi/paranormal phenomena). “I have a motto,” he says, “’entertaining without endorsing’, meaning I see sufficient evidence such that psi phenomena deserve consideration—hundreds of studies that have found positive results. But at the same time, the failures to replicate, and the profound challenges in understanding how it could exist, if it does exist, lead me to feel that we are far from being able to endorse it as being a real phenomenon” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib679" name="bbib679" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib679"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022b</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib682" name="bbib682" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib682"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler et al., 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7175">For example, although accounts of precognition (i.e., the mind perceiving events that have not yet occurred) have been prevalent across human history, Schooler and colleagues say it is no surprise that these claims have been met with strong skepticism, but rather than dismissing the claims, they call for more research to bridge the gap between skeptics and proponents (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib270" name="bbib270" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib270"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Franklin et al., 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7180">While scientists on both sides may usefully vary in the criteria that they set for entertaining and endorsing anomalous cognition, Schooler and colleagues argue that researchers should consider adopting a liberal criterion for entertaining anomalous cognition while maintaining a very strict criterion for the outright endorsement of its existence. Appreciating the justifiability of polar opposite views on psi/paranormal phenomena, Schooler encourage humility on both the part of those who present evidence in support of anomalous cognition and those who dispute the merit of its investigation (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib682" name="bbib682" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib682"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler et al., 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7185">Schooler wonders whether there may be some aspects of existence that may forever elude full scientific scrutiny. He relates two germane examples. “Just as it may never be possible to prove objectively the single thing we know the best, which is our subjective experience of qualia, so it may never be possible to reproduce anomalous cognition events with robust precision and effects” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib679" name="bbib679" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib679"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7190">Seeking potential mechanisms for anomalous cognition or psi/paranormal phenomena, if they were to exist, Schooler speculates that explanations of consciousness and explanations of anomalous cognition are going to be related. “If there is anything to anomalous cognition,” he says, “then it has to do with unexplained aspects of the nature of consciousness itself” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib680" name="bbib680" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib680"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022c</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7195">Pondering what possible structures could explain both consciousness and anomalous cognition, Schooler focuses on the failure of the prevailing third-person perspective of material reductionism to account adequately for the first-person experience of subjectivity, the flow of time, and the present. While acknowledging intrinsic differences among these three ideas, he posits a meta-perspective that experience, the flow of time, and the unique quality of “now” might be accommodated by a subjective dimension or dimensions of time (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib677" name="bbib677" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib677"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2014</span></span></a>). This new dimension of existence, a subjective dimension of time, would be as real as spatial dimensions. It is this subjective dimension, Schooler posits, that, while entirely overlooked by science, may be where the possible realm of anomalous cognition resides as well as being an essential part of the deep explanation of consciousness (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib679" name="bbib679" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib679"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2022b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7200">Alluding to information theory, Schooler considers how a conjoined first-person/third-person meta-perspective could conceptualize subjectivity, the present, and the flow of time within an architecture that closely links information to an ever-changing now. Thus, “c<em>onsciousness arises via the changing informational states associated with an observer's movement through objective time relative to a currently unacknowledged dimension or dimensions of subjective time” (</em><a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib677" name="bbib677" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib677"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7205">Perhaps most dramatically, certainly most controversially, the existence of an additional temporal dimension could be consistent with precognition (knowing the future), which has a vast anecdotal tradition and a serious (if challenged) research program. Schooler asserts that “demonstrating robust findings of precognition could inform theories of how consciousness interfaces with time in a manner not currently considered in modern science” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib677" name="bbib677" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib677"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Schooler, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7210">Given his “resonance theory” and “subjective dimension of time,” what is Schooler's ultimate ontology of consciousness?

When they go apart, that field, as it were, stretches. It doesn't break. The members remain connected at a distance in a way analogous to quantum entanglement.” There is a huge diversity of morphic fields. “Each self-organizing pattern of activity has its own morphic field, and a kind of collective, inherent memory” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib702" name="bbib702" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib702"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sheldrake, 2007a</span></span></a>, n.d.a, n.d.b).</p><p id="p7220">Morphic fields at all levels of complexity have the following characteristics: They are self-organizing wholes; they have both a spatial and a temporal aspect, and organize spatio-temporal patterns of vibratory or rhythmic activity; they attract the systems under their influence towards characteristic forms and patterns of activity; they are a nested hierarchy or holarchy; they are structures of probability, and their organizing activity is probabilistic; and they contain a built-in memory that is cumulative and reinforcing (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib701" name="bbib701" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib701"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sheldrake, n.d.b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7225">Sheldrake's corollary concept of “morphic resonance” expresses this kind of collective memory inherent in nature, the inference of similar prior patterns of activity on subsequent similar patterns of activity—which, once they have occurred, can happen more easily anywhere.

Grinberg claims that “this approach is the one that contemporary physics requires in order to be able to incorporate experience into its realm and thus expand its limits to include life and consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib327" name="bbib327" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib327"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Grinberg-Zylberbaum, 1982</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec17.11"><h3 id="sectitle1110" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.11.

NDEs have been recorded throughout history and across cultures, often associated with mystical traditions.</p><p id="p7275">Of all the requests we receive from viewers of <em>Closer To Truth</em>, NDEs surely rank first, and survival/past lives probably second. My response goes something like this: “I have followed NDE accounts, both experiencers/advocates and skeptics/debunkers, but I do not find sufficient depth and diversity, beyond the obvious confirming enthusiasm of the former and the obvious denying critique of the latter, to warrant the kind of explorations we do on <em>Closer To Truth</em>. We are not in the business of adjudicating claims of NDEs and survival/past lives (as we are not with ESP). What we do is to explore the implications or ramifications of such claims, <em>if they would be true,</em> from an ontological perspective and with critical thinking (which CTT does with ESP).” (For a pioneering and exploratory exception, <em>Closer To Truth</em> features the experimental work of Sam Parnia, a medical scientist who explores NDEs under a new name, “Recalled Experiences of Death [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib599" name="bbib599" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib599"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Parnia et al., 2022</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib598" name="bbib598" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib598"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Parnia, 2014</span></span></a>].)</p><p id="p7280">While popular accounts of NDEs, such as Eben Alexander's <em>Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife</em>, have widespread impact, they are generally not taken seriously by the scientific or medical communities (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib6" name="bbib6" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib6"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Alexander, 2014</span></span></a>).

Every single one!” For example, American belief in life after death has been stable for 75 years at over 70%, even while religious affiliation has been dropping. Mishlove's best evidence for postmortem survival is the big picture of what he says are nine largely independent categories “all pointing to postmortem consciousness:” near-death experience; after-death communications; reincarnation cases; peak in Darian experiences (visions of dead people who are not known at the time to be dead); instrumental trans communication (electronic devices for communication with the deceased; xenoglossy (the ability to converse in a language one has never learned); possession; mental mediumship; and physical mediumship (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib548" name="bbib548" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib548"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Mishlove, 2021</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7295">Dr. Pim van Lommel, a cardiologist, won BICS second prize for his reporting on recent scientific research on NDEs, especially in survivors of cardiac arrest, with “strikingly similar results and conclusions.” His claim is that NDEs seem “to be an authentic experience which cannot be simply reduced to imagination, fear of death, hallucination, psychosis, the use of drugs, or oxygen deficiency.” Using examples of nonlocal consciousness beyond the brain, for instance during a period when the brain is either non-functioning or malfunctioning, he argues that “there are now good reasons to assume that our consciousness does not always coincide with the functioning of our brain: enhanced or nonlocal consciousness can sometimes be experienced separately from the body.” The general conclusion of scientific research on NDE, he says, “is indeed that our enhanced consciousness does not reside in our brain and is not limited to our brain. Our consciousness seems to be nonlocal, and our brain facilitates rather than produces the experience of that consciousness.” He concludes that “death, like birth, may be a mere passing from one state of consciousness into another” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib814" name="bbib814" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib814"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Van Lommel, 2022</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7300">One intriguing parapsychological critique of NDE survival stories is “super-psi” or “living agent psi” where information is gleaned via telepathy or clairvoyance not by post-mortem communications, a position affirmed by <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib84" name="bbib84" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib84"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Braude (1992)</span></span></a> and denied by <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib548" name="bbib548" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib548"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Mishlove (2021)</span></span></a>.</p><p id="p7305">There are of course many physicalist, physiological and psychological critiques of NDEs, OBEs, life-after-death stories, and all the survival arguments; such critiques are widely available. While oxygen deprivation has been a common explanation for NDEs, more sophisticated analysis suggests “a sort of blending of conscious states: waking, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep.” Neurologist Kevin Nelson posits, “The physiological balance between conscious states is disrupted during the conditions of near-death, leading the brainstem arousal system controlling conscious states to blend waking and rapid eye movement consciousness into a hybrid state known as REM intrusion … [and] REM intrusion leads to many key features of near-death, including lying still, visual activation, out-of-body, and the experience's narrative qualities” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib271" name="bbib271" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib271"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Freeman, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7310">That NDEs are being taken more seriously by the scientific community was evidenced by a conference held by The New York Academy of Sciences, “Explorations in Consciousness: Death, Psychedelics, and Mystical Experience.” Participants describe NDEs, which are sometimes called periods of “disconnected consciousness,” as surprisingly common—according to one report, “15 percent of intensive care unit patients and up to 23 percent of survivors of cardiac arrest reported having had one” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib271" name="bbib271" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib271"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Freeman, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7315">The claim is that because more people survive cardiac arrests—due to substantially improved resuscitation techniques—more NDEs are reported and the field has emerged as a legitimate one for scientific inquiry. That NDEs can be emotionally transformative provides opportunity to examine mental health issues, both the positive feelings of enhanced compassion or purpose and the negative after-effects of bad dreams and persistent intrusive thoughts. Calling evolutionary explanations for NDEs “just-so stories,” Christof Koch said, “They may be true. They may be false. It just doesn't matter.

DOPS's consciousness research and theory</h3><p id="p7325">The Division of Perceptual Studies (DOPS), a research unit within the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia, has contributed both empirically and conceptually to emerging nonphysical theories of consciousness, which picture mind as irreducible and grounded in some sort of highest consciousness which forms the ontological foundation of reality as a whole. DOPS cognitive scientist/parapsychologist Ed Kelly contends that “the limitations of contemporary mainstream consciousness theorizing derive from the systematic unwillingness of the physicalist camp to take difficult empirical phenomena such as psi and mystical experience into account” (DOPS, n.d.<em>;</em> <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib443" name="bbib443" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib443"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kelly, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7330">DOPS was founded in 1967 by psychiatrist Ian Stevenson and has been dedicated to research related to the possibility of postmortem survival. According to Kelly, “Survival is a watershed issue theoretically, in that demonstration of its occurrence as an empirical reality would immediately rule out most if not quite all of the materialism theories. Clearly, if the prevailing physicalist ‘production’ model of mind-brain relations is correct in claiming that mind and consciousness are manufactured entirely by neurophysiological processes occurring in brains, then it follows logically and inescapably that postmortem survival is impossible, period” (DOPS, n.d.<em>;</em> <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib443" name="bbib443" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib443"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kelly, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7335">DOPS staff have published hundreds of research papers in refereed journals, plus over a score of books, on reincarnation, near-death experiences (NDEs) and other survival-related topics such as crisis apparitions, mediumship, and after-death communications (DOPS, website). Stevenson himself was the primary architect of a major project involving small children who begin at a very early age to speak and act as though they are remembering, or expressing behaviorally, potentially verifiable events that took place in the life of a recently deceased person. Most interestingly are the relatively few cases in which the child's statements and behaviors were well documented before the previous personality (PP) was identified. Stevenson found “cases of the reincarnation type” (CORT) everywhere he looked, primarily but not exclusively in sociocultural settings where their occurrence is not unexpected. He and various colleagues have so far investigated over 2500 cases, around 2000 of which have been deemed of sufficient quality to merit laborious encoding of associated variables for inclusion in a cumulative database. Systematic properties include a very high proportion of violent or premature death in the PPs, which, DOPS researchers speculate, might relate to why some children remember but others do not. Other findings include confusions surrounding gender in children who report memories of a life as a person of the opposite sex. Stevenson paid special attention to a subset of over 200 cases in which the child displays birthmarks or birth defects, often extremely unusual in form, corresponding to fatal injuries suffered by the PP (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib736" name="bbib736" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib736"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stevenson, 1997</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7340">Another major line of research, spearheaded by psychiatrist Bruce Greyson, has focused on NDEs. Greyson and colleagues have investigated a large number of such cases and created a second DOPS database containing over a thousand what they consider good cases. Of special interest are the hundreds of cases in which NDEs have occurred under extreme physiological conditions such as deep general anesthesia and/or cardiac arrest, conditions in which almost all contemporary neuroscientists would expect that patients should report no conscious experience whatsoever, let alone the most meaningful and transformative experiences of their lives—in effect, mystical experiences occurring under life-threatening conditions. Numerous physiological explanations have been offered for NDEs, but none, DOPS argues, can withstand scrutiny (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib324" name="bbib324" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib324"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Greyson et al., 2009</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7345">Of particular interest here is the DOPS theoretical work opposing physicalism, led by Ed Kelly and involving fifty or so scholars from diverse academic disciplines (over a period of more than two decades). Motivated by DOPS's empirical studies, DOPS's theorizing in regard to the mind/brain relationship and consciousness are presented in three books. The first is <em>Irreducible Mind</em>, which describes various psychophysical phenomena that appear difficult or impossible to explain in conventional physicalist terms. These include psi and survival data, along with other non-standard empirical phenomena such as stigmata and hypnotically induced blisters; prodigious forms of memory and calculation; psychological automatisms and hidden or secondary centers of consciousness; near-death and out-of-body experiences, emphasizing experiences occurring under extreme physiological conditions; genius-level creativity such as that of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan; and mystical experiences, whether spontaneous, pharmacologically induced, or occurring in conjunction with transformative practices such as an intense meditative discipline of some sort (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib445" name="bbib445" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib445"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kelly et al., 2007</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7350">The main import of <em>Irreducible Mind</em>, apart from its systematic empirical attack on physicalism, Kelly says, is to marshal support for a model of the human psyche advanced by F. W.H. Myers and developed philosophically by William James. Contrary to today's prevailing conception, which views everyday consciousness as the only consciousness, generated entirely by physiological processes in the nervous system, the Myers/James picture includes at least one level of normally hidden and more comprehensive consciousness that exists independently of the organism and is equipped with “adits and operations” of its own which provide access to wider and deeper parts of the reality in which we find ourselves embedded (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib562" name="bbib562" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib562"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Myers, 1903</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7355">According to Kelly, this sort of “permission” or “transmission” or “filter” model of the psyche (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib408" name="bbib408" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib408"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">James, 1900</span></span></a>), in which everyday consciousness takes forms dependent on interactions between a more inclusive and capacious consciousness and an organism that serves mainly as a sensorimotor interface, may initially sound strange to our modern ears, but, Kelly argues, “there is now a lot of evidence to support it.” It also has strong affinities to views advanced by Bergson (17.1), Jung (17.2), and the Indian philosophical tradition with its “subtle” mental and physical worlds interposed between everyday experience and an ultimate consciousness of some sort (16.1, 16.7, 16.9, 16.10, 16.13). Ongoing research seeks to identify conditions in the mind and body that encourage what Myers termed “subliminal uprush”, or expression in everyday consciousness of information and capacities normally confined to James's hidden “More”—for example, using functional neuroimaging techniques for research on meditation and psychedelics.</p><p id="p7360">The second book, <em>Beyond Physicalism</em>, is more explicitly theoretical, seeking to identify alternative conceptual frameworks, or worldviews, or metaphysical systems, that could permit the psi or paranormal empirical phenomena catalogued in the first book to occur. These include a range of theories: a modernized form of interactive dualism (15.8); process philosophy (13.12); quantum theories of Henry Stapp (11.2), Harald Atmanspacher (14.7), Bernard Carr (11.10); mystically-informed philosophies such as those of the Neoplatonists, Samkhya/Yoga, and Kashmiri Shaivism, and Western philosophical figures including Leibniz, Peirce, and Whitehead (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib446" name="bbib446" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib446"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kelly et al., 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7365">Kelly argues that the central tendency is toward some sort of Idealism (16), most likely of the type known as (evolutionary) panentheism (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib362" name="bbib362" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib362"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hartshorne and Reese, 2000</span></span></a>). Kelly stresses that “The precise form that an adequate theory will take is powerfully constrained by the need for it to incorporate or at least respect the discoveries of modern physics, making it an objective or realist idealism as opposed to a subjective idealism of the sort advocated by Bishop Berkeley.” Several of Kelly's collaborators—Federico Faggin (11.12), Bernard Carr (11.10), and Bernardo Kastrup (16.4)—are explicitly working in this direction, as is Mira Albahari (16.13) from the perspective of Indian idealisms. All such theories, Kelly points out, can potentially make room not only for “rogue” phenomena such as psi and survival, genius, and mystical experience, but also for experiences of value, meaning and purpose so vital to real human life. Conversely, Kelly believes that these metaphysical frameworks imply “poor prospects for artificial <em>general</em> intelligence and virtual immortality” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib443" name="bbib443" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib443"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kelly, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7370">The third book, <em>Consciousness Unbound</em> (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib444" name="bbib444" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib444"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kelly and Marshall, 2021</span></span></a>), has three parts.

Bitbol's phenomenological ontology</h3><p id="p7375">Philosopher of science Michel Bitbol suggests that a radical view of neurophenomenology (9.6.5) amplifies “the available range of interpretations of altered states of consciousness, from OBEs and NDEs to meditation and psychedelics, and which may suggest a new ontological category. There are generally three such interpretations, he says: “two objectivist-realist and one non-committal (mild) phenomenological interpretation.” According to the objectivist-realist approaches, he says, “these states refer to worldly or other-worldly objective processes. They refer either to an alteration of the brain's biochemical balance, thus giving rise to hallucinations, or to a backstage supernatural (but ‘real’) world which discloses itself to (say) dying people.”</p><p id="p7385">In contrast, Bitbol says, “according to the non-committal phenomenological approach, instead, these states are relevant by themselves, as transformative experiences for those who live through them.” This latter approach, advocated by Evan Thompson as well as by Bitbol, take “a decisive step beyond the sterile conflict between naturalism and super-naturalism. It shows that despite their superficial disagreement, both positions share the same crucial but disputable strategy: escaping one's own lived embodied situation and striving towards some (natural or super-natural) transcendent realm of being” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib53" name="bbib53" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib53"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2015</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib792" name="bbib792" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib792"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Thompson, 2014</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7390">Bitbol sees a big vision here. “But the clarifying role of phenomenology is not bound to stop at this point. One can take further advantage of a truly radical phenomenological approach, and thereby endow the transformative experiences with additional significance. According to Merleau-Ponty (who partly agreed with Heidegger and Sartre on this point), phenomenology, in its mature state, becomes a new form of ontology: not a straightforward ontology of things facing an observer, however, but an ‘oblique ontology’ of intertwining with what there is (Saint Aubert, 2006); not an ontology of manifest beings, but an ontology of self-manifesting being. As Merleau-Ponty writes, radical phenomenology does not yield a standard ‘exo-ontology,’ but rather an unexplored ‘endo-ontology.’ Merleau-Ponty here unambiguously alludes to an ontology expressed from the innermost recesses of the process of being, rather than to an ontology of the external contemplation of beings” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib53" name="bbib53" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib53"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2015</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7395">This granted, Bitbol argues, “some altered states of consciousness can be understood neither dismissively as illusions, nor neutrally as enthralling experiences, but positively as revealing a state of being which happens to be hidden by intellectual fabrications and by the impulse of intentional directedness.” Here, to avoid misunderstandings, Bitbol clarifies that “unlike in super-naturalism, there is no question here of reaching some remote domain of transcendent being, but only of self-disclosing an exquisitely proximate mode of being, which is permanently present but usually neglected: perhaps what Tibetan Dzogchen practitioners call ‘the nature of mind,’ which, in this nondualist context, is likely to be simultaneously the (self-experienced) nature of being” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib53" name="bbib53" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib53"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Bitbol, 2015</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec17.15"><h3 id="sectitle1130" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.15.

The physical world is an illusion, a virtual reality that only exists in our minds. We are Individuated Units of Consciousness: immortal, interconnected parts of a Larger Consciousness System. We choose to be players in the virtual reality game called life on Earth, set in a virtual universe computed by the system to aid our consciousness evolution.… Our goal: to learn from the outcomes of our choices in order to grow up and evolve the quality of our consciousness from fear to love. By evolving our individual consciousness quality from one round of the game to the next, we advance the evolution of the entire consciousness system” (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib103" name="bbib103" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib103"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Campbell, 2003/2007, n.d.</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7405">Rejecting Dualism, Materialism and Idealism, Campbell claims all questions and objections are answered and resolved “if we conceive of the physical universe as a virtual reality,” the core idea of My Big TOE. Moreover, My Big TOE “provides entirely rational explanations for many phenomena dismissed by mainstream science as ‘weird’ (quantum effects), ‘mysterious’ (consciousness), ‘illusory’ (free will) or ‘delusions’ (paranormal experiences).” For example, paranormal phenomena are natural artifacts of a virtual universe.</p><p id="p7410">As for the hard problem of consciousness, it is supposedly “solved—or rather, dissolved—once we drop our belief in a fundamental external reality.” The virtual reality model helps us do that, Campbell says. In this view, “our subjective perception is not some ‘internal' representation of an ‘external’ world: There is no objective world outside of us.”</p><p id="p7415">But if our reality is a simulation, who or what is doing the simulating? Is this not just kicking all the conundrums, such as consciousness, up a level? My Big TOE is ready with a “Larger Consciousness System” (LCS) that computes virtual realities, noting, unlike the God of religions, LCS “demands neither praise nor worship.”</p><p id="p7420">In the very beginning, Campbell's big conjecture goes, “all that may have existed was an Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO)—an undifferentiated, elementary consciousness with a potential to evolve into the highly complex, unfathomably vast LCS of today. AUO was barely aware, but it did have the potential to develop all the attributes of consciousness, including awareness, perception, cognition and free-will choice-making.”</p><p id="p7425">Driven, somehow, by an inherent drive towards complexity, “when AUO reached its evolutionary limits as a monolithic block of consciousness, a single source of choosing, it made a crucial decision: AUO split itself into unfathomably many interconnected but autonomous pieces, a process we can imagine like partitioning a computer hard drive into multiple partitions. The idea was for all the different pieces to build something more innovative and creative than a single mind would ever be able to come up with.” At that fateful moment, Campbell says, “the One became the Many: the Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO) turned into an Absolute Unbounded Manifold (AUM),” which led to the genesis of the Larger Consciousness System,” which provides, according to My Big TOE, the simulations of our virtual universe today (Campbell, 2003/2007, n.d.).</p></section><section id="sec17.16"><h3 id="sectitle1135" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.16.

There is no such thing, then, as ‘lifeless matter.’ Matter, in its very structure and dynamism, generates life.” Consciousness, then, is built into the fundamental fabric of the universe.

The universe is a vast arrangement of digital information and the mathematical relationships between them. At the same time, “it is only through consciousness that we can perceive or know anything at all. Thus, our reality can just as well be conceived as a vast network of conscious experiences: perceptions and the laws which govern them.” Because there is nothing outside reality, reality must contain all of the conditions necessary for its own existence, and given sufficient time, “even mere possibility is enough to ensure that it generates itself” (Section: <em>CTMU Wiki</em>, n.d.).</p><p id="p7470">Although this kind of mind, which Langan calls God's mind, “sits in knowledge of itself in an unchanging, eternal way, it contains within it all of the processes required for it to refine itself into existence out of nothingness.” It is here, according to CTMU, that “consciousness is stratified: the bottom stratum is the all-knowing mind of God,” within which “all of the more superficial strata of consciousness” are contained. From God's perspective, God “is aware of all the steps in its own creation.” However, from the perspective of these more superficial strata—of which our human minds are pieces—the universe appears as a physical entity unfolding in physical space. But because “our conscious minds are contained within God's consciousness … we retain the creative power and freedom of God on a scale that is localized in time and space.”</p><p id="p7475">CTMU describes reality as “a Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language, a reflexive intrinsic language characterized not only by self-reference and recursive self-definition, but by full self-configuration and self-execution” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib478" name="bbib478" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib478"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Langan, 2002</span></span></a>).

If we act against the telos, what happens may be that those elements of our minds that do not match the mind of God get recycled endlessly until they properly refine themselves.”</p><p id="p7480">In short, CTMU's reality “is a self-refining informational system which, due to its form, cannot NOT exist. Even if there is nothingness, this system will exist and know itself and all of the localized conscious minds within its creation process will experience its informational structure as real, physical, etc. It is thus self-creating, as it requires nothing outside of itself to exist” (<em>CTMU Wiki</em>, n.d.).</p></section><section id="sec17.20"><h3 id="sectitle1155" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">17.20.

It is perhaps Nagel's footnote on the phrase that has had the most lasting impact: “Therefore the analogical form of the English expression "what it is like" is misleading.

The mystery persists.

McGinn describes his position as “existential naturalism.”</p><p id="p7630">McGinn stresses that consciousness in our universe is contingent, not necessary, so it could have been that while the physical laws obtained, no consciousness ever evolved. “Not every world has consciousness in it, so our world might have been a world in which there was no consciousness.” This is why, McGinn says, “I'm opposed to the idealist view, or the panpsychist view,” that “the physical world itself is somehow inherently spiritual.” He says it is “incontestable that consciousness arises solely from the material world” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib530" name="bbib530" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib530"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">McGinn, 2007a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7635">What are possible deep mechanisms? “[Some] have to bring God in to explain how the mind comes into existence,” a view that McGinn finds unacceptable. “You might hope you can jettison God from the picture so you have a more scientific version of dualism.”</p><p id="p7640">McGinn reveals a wild speculation that he once entertained, a bizarre idea that gives insight into how profound the explanatory problem. “I once played with the idea that there were two universes, which existed through all eternity,” McGinn muses. “There's a material universe and there's a conscious universe; they were coarsely isolated, but at some point in universal history there was a kind of causal breakthrough between the two.” With this mechanism, consciousness occurs in this “conjoined double universe” because it had existed in the conscious universe for all eternity. “That's a very far out theory,” McGinn smiles, “nobody's ever maintained that theory … not even me.

S. Harris's mystery of consciousness</h3><p id="p7650">Philosopher, author, and neuroscientist Sam Harris, who is not known for timidity in offering opinions, does not offer his own theory of consciousness. Instead, he offers a mystery. The problem, he says, “is that no evidence for consciousness exists in the physical world.” By this he means that “physical events are simply mute as to whether it is ‘like something’ to be what they are. The only thing in this universe that attests to the existence of consciousness is consciousness itself; the only clue to subjectivity, as such, is subjectivity.” To Harris, it is not an “explanatory gap; ” it's an unbridgeable gap (Section: <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib348" name="bbib348" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib348"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Harris, 2011</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7655">While Harris of course appreciates high correlations between mental states and brain states, “absolutely nothing about a brain, when surveyed as a physical system,” he says, “suggests that it is a locus of experience.” Consciousness seems the obvious fact about our world, but, “were we not already brimming with consciousness ourselves, we would find no evidence of it in the physical universe—nor would we have any notion of the many experiential states that it gives rise to.”</p><p id="p7660">“While we know many things about ourselves in anatomical, physiological, and evolutionary terms,” Harris continues, “we do not know why it is ‘like something’ to be what we are. The fact that the universe is illuminated where you stand—that your thoughts and moods and sensations have a qualitative character—is a mystery, exceeded only by the mystery that there should be something rather than nothing in this universe. How is it that unconscious events can give rise to consciousness? Not only do we have no idea, but it seems impossible to imagine what sort of idea could fit in the space provided” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib348" name="bbib348" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib348"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Harris, 2011</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7665">Harris targets emergence as a false friend in the pursuit of consciousness. He recognizes that “most scientists are confident that consciousness emerges from unconscious complexity.” Nevertheless, “this notion of emergence” strikes Harris “as nothing more than a restatement of a miracle. To say that consciousness emerged at some point in the evolution of life doesn't give us an inkling of how it could emerge from unconscious processes, even in principle.” He stresses, “This notion of emergence is incomprehensible,” then he doubles down: “The idea that consciousness is identical to (or emerged from) unconscious physical events is, I would argue, impossible to properly conceive—which is to say that we can think we are thinking it, but we are mistaken. We can say the right words, of course—'consciousness emerges from unconscious information processing.’ We can also say ‘Some squares are as round as circles’ and ‘2 plus 2 equals 7.’ But are we really thinking these things all the way through? I don't think so.”</p><p id="p7670">Harris asserts that “Consciousness—the sheer fact that this universe is illuminated by sentience—is precisely what unconsciousness is not. And I believe that no description of unconscious complexity will fully account for it … an analysis of purely physical processes will never yield a picture of consciousness.” Does Harris then hedge? However, he says, “this is not to say that some other thesis about consciousness must be true. Consciousness may very well be the lawful product of unconscious information processing.” But his apparent hedge is a feint. “But I don't know what that sentence means,” he declares, “and I don't think anyone else does either.”</p><p id="p7675">Continuing, Harris asks, “Couldn't a mature neuroscience nevertheless offer a proper explanation of human consciousness in terms of its underlying brain processes?” It's the common consensus among most neuroscientists, which Harris unambiguously rejects. “Reductions of this sort are neither possible nor conceptually coherent,” he says. “Nothing about a brain, studied at any scale (spatial or temporal), even suggests that it might harbor consciousness. Nothing about human behavior, or language, or culture, demonstrates that these products are mediated by subjectivity. We simply know that they are—a fact that we appreciate in ourselves directly and in others by analogy.”</p><p id="p7680">While Harris is hardly optimistic about science's long-future prospects “to dispel the fundamental mystery of our mental life,” and he has little time for conventional religious doctrines, he does see a role for introspection. “Many truths about ourselves will be discovered in consciousness directly,” he says, “or not discovered at all” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib348" name="bbib348" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib348"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Harris, 2011</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec18.4"><h3 id="sectitle1185" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">18.4.

There are alternative theories that could be the case.”</p><p id="p7715">Eagleman stresses he is <u>not</u> saying he subscribes to these alternative theories, but notes, “let me just say, agnostically, they are perfectly possible.” No doubt, he concludes, “our mind is integrally dependent on the brain.” But “whether this is all that's required or whether there's something else that our science is too young to understand, that's the open question” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib226" name="bbib226" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib226"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Eagleman, 2011b</span></span></a>).</p></section><section id="sec18.5"><h3 id="sectitle1190" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">18.5. Tallis's anti-neuromania skepticism</h3><p id="p7720">Philosopher and humanist Raymond Tallis, a former geriatric neurologist and clinical neuroscientist, has a baffling yet coherent and penetrating perspective on consciousness (my highest compliment) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib764" name="bbib764" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib764"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tallis, 2011a</span></span></a>). He is anti-reductionist in principle, not just in practice, asserting, “We have failed to explain how consciousness equates to neural activity inside the skull because the task is self-contradictory in that we cannot access qualitative, subjective consciousness by means of an objective, often quantitative approach.” There is an inevitable failure to explain consciousness in terms of neural activity because there is nothing in such activity that can “explain the ‘aboutness’ of mental entities, the simultaneous unity and multiplicity of the moments of consciousness, the explicit presence of the past, the initiation of actions that point to an as yet non-existent future, the construction of self” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib763" name="bbib763" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib763"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tallis, 2010</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7725">Nor can we explain “appearings,” Tallis argues, because we are constrained by “an objective approach that has set aside appearings as unreal and which seeks reality in mass/energy that neither appears in itself nor has the means to make other items appear.

Let me take a simple example. I'm looking at a yellow object. That will correspond to neural activity in my occipital cortex, at the back of the brain. That neural activity is quite unlike the phenomenal appearance of a yellow object. Yet, according to those who believe in ‘neurophilosophy,’ the actual phenomenal appearance of the yellow object—my experience of yellowness—is identical with neural activity in the back of the brain. Now, if those two things really were identical, well, at least you might expect them to look a little bit like each other, and of course, they don't. So, to engender conscious experience, there must be something more than neural activity.” The brain is no doubt necessary, according to Tallis, but it is certainly not sufficient (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib764" name="bbib764" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib764"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tallis, 2011a</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7735">Tallis runs down the list of potential explanations.

He argues that such a possibility would be devastating to theories of consciousness because it would undermine all traditional responses to the mind-body problem, such as physicalism, dualism, idealism and neutral monism. Attempts to rescue physicalism from such an argument do not succeed, he argues, because “Physicalism (and any alternative to it) turns out to be an unfalsifiable, unverifiable, and unstable metaphysical view” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib568" name="bbib568" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib568"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Nagasawa, 2012b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7760">However, “Their failures might motivate a unique form of monism that is radically different from physicalism as commonly formulated.” It leads to a “priority monism” because “It motivates us to seek fundamentality on the top, rather than on the bottom, level of reality.” The main difference between priority monism and traditional micro-fundamentalism, Nagasawa says, is that “Priority monism regards the whole universe, rather than its ultimate components, as most fundamental. Locating the fundamental level at the top enables priority monism to secure a firm [if unusual] metaphysical ground”—because then, the totality of everything, including all that we call physical entities and mental entities, is the single fundamental entity, of which all of its components are derivative.</p><p id="p7765">Nagasawa concedes that while what he has is truly a monism, with exactly one fundamental entity, it is neither monism nor dualism in the context of the mind-body problem.

Davies's consciousness in the cosmos</h3><p id="p7790">Physicist and polymath Paul Davies asserts the heterodox view among scientists that consciousness is something very significant in the evolution of the universe. “Although we see consciousness only in response to some set of physical systems, nevertheless it seems to me to play an absolute and fundamental role. Because at one level, all of science, our whole understanding of the universe, comes through our own consciousness. It's actually the starting point of all inquiry” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib187" name="bbib187" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib187"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Davies, 2006b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7795">But what of the minuscule place of consciousness amidst the unfathomably vast universe? Davies muses: “Is consciousness on the surface of our planet just a little embellishment on the great scheme of things or does it have fundamental role? I should also say that whether it's fundamental or not, we surely have to explain it. It has got to fit into our scientific picture of the world, but I don't think we've got a clue as to how to go about it because none of the concepts from fundamental physics, like mass and momentum and charge, seem relevant at all.”</p><p id="p7800">With respect to whether consciousness really matters to quantum physics, Davies says that physicists are sharply split and that he himself has oscillated. “I used to think that consciousness was just getting in the way of understanding. But because I'm convinced that consciousness is a fundamental part of the universe, I'd like to find a place for it in physics. And the one place that it has been ‘on again and off again’ is within the realm of quantum physics. So, consciousness could enter quantum physics at the point of observation where the rules of the quantum game change as a result of that observation or measurement” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib187" name="bbib187" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib187"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Davies, 2006b</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7805">Davies is critical of the many-world interpretation (MWI) of the Schrödinger equation that governs the wave function of quantum mechanical systems. While MWI adherents argue they are literalists, Davies counters that “it's a way of trying to get rid of consciousness from playing a fundamental role in quantum physics.” He calls MWI a “missed opportunity,” because “if we're going to actually incorporate consciousness into our description of physics it's at the quantum level that we should attempt to do so.”</p><p id="p7810">Can one then go from consciousness at the quantum level to consciousness at the universe level, not just as metaphor but to actually explain reality? Davies focuses on the challenge of giving a cosmic significance to consciousness because, as far as we know, there are so vanishingly few conscious beings in the vast universe (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib187" name="bbib187" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib187"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Davies, 2006b</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib188" name="bbib188" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib188"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">2006c</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7815">Davies looks to the far future of the universe. “It seems entirely possible that human beings or alien beings or any sort of conscious beings are going to spread out across the universe. We think a universe of 13.8 billion years is old; in fact, it's exceedingly young. There's no reason why it can't go on for trillions and trillions of years. There's absolutely plenty of time for it to become full of minds, full of observers. And we can imagine a time in the far, far future when mind and the universe in effect merge: they become one. And so the act of observation which at the moment is limited to maybe a little corner of the universe could saturate the whole universe. The whole universe could become self-known.”</p><p id="p7820">But could what might happen in the future affect what has happened in the past? Davies explains: “Part of the weirdness of quantum physics is that observations which are made now can affect the nature of reality in the past.”</p><p id="p7825">This is not “backward causation,” he stresses, but a selection among myriad alternate possible histories, a developmental history of the universe that makes sense only in the quantum realm. This is why Davies can say that “observations made in the very far future can affect the nature of reality today and even back at the Big Bang.”</p><p id="p7830">Davies concludes with the grand vision: “if you buy this whole quantum physics package and you have this universe saturated by mind, saturated by observers, then indeed the whole character of the universe, including the original emergence of its laws and the nature of its states, become inextricably intertwined with its mentality, with its mindfulness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib187" name="bbib187" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib187"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Davies, 2006b</span></span></a>).</p></section></section><section id="sec19"><h2 id="sectitle1210" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">19.

The initial problem is the hard problem of consciousness: why and how do physical processes in the brain give rise to conscious experience? The meta-problem is the problem of explaining why we think consciousness poses a hard problem, or in other terms, the problem of explaining why we think consciousness is hard to explain.” Equivalently, it is the problem of explaining why people have problem intuitions … including metaphysical intuitions (“consciousness is non-physical”), explanatory intuitions (“physical processes can't fully explain consciousness”), knowledge intuitions (“someone who knows all about the brain but has never seen colors doesn't know what it’s like to see red”), and modal intuitions (“we can imagine all these physical processes without consciousness”). There are also intuitions about the value of consciousness, the distribution of consciousness, and more (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib133" name="bbib133" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib133"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Chalmers, 2018</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p7920">In a special issue of the <em>Journal of Consciousness Studies</em> dedicated to the meta-problem of consciousness, 39 colleagues respond to Chalmers.

Our solution takes as its starting point the emerging picture of the brain as a hierarchical inference engine. We show why such a device, operating under familiar forms of adaptive pressure, may come to represent some of its mid-level inferences as especially certain. These mid-level states confidently re-code raw sensory stimulation in ways that (they are able to realize) fall short of fully determining how properties and states of affairs are arranged in the distal world. This drives a wedge between experience and the world.

What could justify our continued confidence in the existence of consciousness once all our intuitions about it have been explained away? The answer would involve heavy-duty metaphysical theorizing, probably including a commitment either to substance dualism or to the existence of a mysterious intrinsic subjectivity.

So, I've thought a lot about panpsychism, the idea that consciousness is fundamental in the universe—and how you can overcome the problems for that kind of view. I've thought about the idea that consciousness might play a role in quantum mechanics, and how that might help provide a role for consciousness in the universe.

And that, in my view, also applies to organisms produced by normal processes—there may be a law determining that a person with a certain character emerges as a result of fertilization of an egg, but the law could not determine which person that was; for the simple reason that laws deal with the causation of states of affairs of certain kinds by other states of affairs of certain kinds; and given that a duplicate of me isn't necessarily me, no law of nature could determine that I would have been born from my actual parents” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib754" name="bbib754" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib754"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Swinburne, 2016</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8150">Now, for each of the categories of explanations of consciousness, a conjecture: In which could AI become conscious?</p><p id="p8155"><u>Materialism Theories (9)</u>: Sure. For Materialism Theories (with all its subcategories) to be consistent, AI consciousness must be in principle absolutely sure. There is no possibility that, given materialism, AI consciousness would be forbidden. If one argues that consciousness must be embodied, fine, then materialism will build a body. Remember, we are speaking in ultimate principle, not in current practice, and there are no time limits. (Dehaene, Lau and Kouider assert that to build machines that are conscious, novel machine architectures must be based on information-processing computations similar to those of the human brain, especially global workspace and higher-order theories [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib197" name="bbib197" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib197"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Dehaene et al., 2017</span></span></a>].)</p><p id="p8160">If materialism explains consciousness entirely (without residue), then it would be certainly true that non-biological intelligences with super-strong AI would eventually have the same kind of inner awareness that humans do. Moreover, as AI would break through the singularity and become vastly more sophisticated than the human brain, it would likely express forms of consciousness higher than we today can even imagine. Though some speculatively reject that AI could ever become conscious (e.g., <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib642" name="bbib642" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib642"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Reber, 2016</span></span></a>; <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib643" name="bbib643" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib643"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Reber, 2018</span></span></a>), if one takes a hard-core physicalist position, an immutably skeptical outlook may not be warranted (and may not be coherent).</p><p id="p8165">To the degree that language affects the deep essence of consciousness, this would make AI consciousness more likely, given the exponential advances in AI language development. But language per se is certainly not sufficient and likely not necessary.</p><p id="p8170"><u>Non-Reductive Physicalism (10)</u>. If Non-Reductive Physicalism is true, then it would be almost certainly true that non-biological intelligences could eventually be conscious—although the independent reality of mental states attenuates (slightly, unpredictably) the likelihood of inner awareness—an argument that is itself countered by functionalism (if functionalism is true). However, if strong emergence and top-down causation were required, then both would have to be enabled in creating AI consciousness, a process that would require two orders of complexity (i.e., strong emergence and top-down causation as real phenomena, and then their artificial creation).</p><p id="p8175"><u>Quantum Theories (11)</u>. If quantum mechanics is the key to consciousness, with its exponential amplification of processing power and its vast parallel pathways working simultaneously, Quantum Theories would be the lead category for generating AI consciousness. The one caveat, a practical but not an in-principle obstacle, would be the physical constraints of manipulating myriad quantum states, with their inherent indeterminacies and environmental sensitivities, making the technology even more daunting. However, the technology is accelerating with fervor and so if AI consciousness is to happen, by design or by default, Quantum Theories is likely how and where it will happen.</p><p id="p8180"><u>Integrated Information Theory (12)</u>. If consciousness requires an independent, non-reducible feature of physical reality—say, IIT's “qualia space”—then it would remain an open question whether non-biological intelligences could ever experience true inner awareness. (It would depend on the deep nature of the consciousness-causing feature in qualia space, and whether this feature could be controlled by technology.)</p><p id="p8185"><u>Panpsychisms (13)</u>. If panpsychism explains consciousness such that proto-consciousness is a non-reducible property of every elementary physical field and particle, then it would seem likely that AI could experience true inner awareness (because consciousness would be an intrinsic part of the fabric of reality). Panpsychism introduces more complexity than does materialism because panpsychism must solve its combination problem (but this problem must be solved anyway in order for panpsychism to be the winning theory). In addition, AI consciousness under panpsychism turns on whether the micropsychic aspects can be manipulated by advanced technology.</p><p id="p8190"><u>Monisms (14)</u>. Monisms, almost by definition, should pose no problem for AI consciousness, as everything everywhere is the same stuff. A possible exception would be if God or something like God (if it exists) were involved.</p><p id="p8195"><u>Dualisms (15)</u>. The major holdout to AI consciousness, as I see it (at this particular moment), would be if dualism were true and consciousness requires a radically separate, nonphysical substance not causally determined by the physical world. It would then seem impossible that non-biological intelligences, no matter how super-strong their AI, could ever experience true inner awareness, at least the varieties of dualism where God or something like God was doing the creating and/or allocating. Emergent dualism, where unfathomable but conceivable psychophysical laws generate “souls” (or nonphysical components) based on certain principles of physical complexity, would be an exception and could generate AI consciousness almost as surely as materialism, though requiring this extra process.</p><p id="p8200"><u>Idealisms (16)</u>. As Idealism holds that everything everywhere is already consciousness in some primitive sense, that fundamental consciousness is ultimate reality, then anything could be (or is) conscious (whatever that may mean), including non-biological entities. However, the question turns on how fundamental consciousness would be related to personal consciousness, and if so, could even maximally advanced technology manipulate it? (Idealist philosopher Bernardo Kastrup, also a computer scientist, says “Conscious AI is a fantasy,” though for reasons based mostly on current concepts of computers [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib436" name="bbib436" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib436"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2023</span></span></a>].)</p><p id="p8205"><u>Anomalous and Altered States Theories (17)</u>. Because Anomalous and Altered States theories of consciousness require “something” beyond, or in addition to, materialism, that “something” would ipso facto need to generate AI consciousness. While unknowable practically, it does not seem an insurmountable barrier conceptually. For example, it could be the case that when a system is of a sufficient kind of complexity it “automatically” taps into the “grid,” as it were, of another realm of reality. Alternatively, Anomalous and Altered States theories may simply be taken, by their adherents, as evidence of Quantum, Dualism or Idealism theories, in which case the theory of choice would determine the possibility of AI consciousness.</p><p id="p8210">To summarize, in assessing AI consciousness, here are my (tentative) conclusions for each category: Materialism Theories: Yes. Non-Reductive physicalism: Likely. Quantum Theories: Yes (the lead category). Integrated Information Theory: Uncertain. Panpsychism: Probably. Monism: Likely (some). Dualism: No (mostly). Idealism: Likely. Anomalous and Altered States Theories: Possibly.</p><p id="p8215">I agree that after super-strong AI exceeds some threshold, science could never distinguish, not even in principle, actual inner awareness from apparent inner awareness. But I do not agree with what often follows: that this everlasting uncertainty about inner awareness and conscious experience in non-biological entities makes the question irrelevant. I think the question remains maximally relevant.</p><p id="p8220">In all aspects of behavior and communications, these non-biological intelligences, such as super-strong AI robots, would seem to be equal to (or, more likely, superior to) humans. But if super-strong AI robots did not, in fact, have the felt sense of inner experience, they would be “zombies” (“philosophical zombies”), externally identical to conscious beings, but with no mental content, nothing inside. Moreover, this difference between super-strong AI being conscious and merely appearing conscious would become even more crucial if, by some objective standard, humanlike inner awareness conveys some kind of “intrinsic worthiness” with moral rights and privileges.</p><p id="p8225">Consider cosmos-colonizing robots driven by super-strong AI. The stark dichotomy between conscious and non-conscious entities elicits a probative question about self-replicating robots, which, unless we destroy ourselves or our planet, will eventually colonize the cosmos. Post-singularity, would super-strong AI robots without inner awareness be in all respects as powerful as super-strong AI robots with inner awareness, and in no respects deficient? That is, are there kinds of cognition that, in principle or of necessity, require true inner felt experience?</p><p id="p8230">Moreover, would conscious galaxy-traversing robots, with true inner felt experience, represent a higher form of intrinsic worthiness and absolute value? I can argue that unless our robotic probes were literally conscious, even if they were to colonize every object in the universe, the absence of inner felt experience would mean a diminished intrinsic worth, and, by extension, a diminished universe. For assessing the profound nature and value of robotic probes colonizing the cosmos, for assessing what it means to colonize the cosmos, the question of consciousness is axial.</p></section><section id="sec24"><h2 id="sectitle1235" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">24.

Consciousness is the elephant in the room, though many refuse to see it. They assume, almost as an article of faith, that super-strong AI (post-singularity) will inevitably be conscious (perhaps ipso facto). They may be correct, but to make that judgment requires an analysis that is surely multifaceted and, I suspect, likely inconclusive.</p><p id="p8255">Whatever consciousness may be, it determines whether virtual immortality in the strong sense of true first-person survival is even possible. That's why, here, to assess prospects of virtual immortality, I do so in the context of the Landscape's diverse categories of the explanations or theories of consciousness.</p><p id="p8260">First, however, there are two other potential obstacles to virtual immortality.

The list goes on.</p><p id="p8270">How much of all of this complexity is required for total virtual duplication such that the mental fullness of the original person can be said to exist? Who knows?</p><p id="p8275">Granted, much of the brain is not needed for consciousness and its contents; much of the machinery of the brain is metabolic. The bodily control mechanisms, such as regulating breathing, heart rate and digestion would be of no value in non-biological substrates. On the other hand, several theories of consciousness suggest that bodily sense is needed for normal cognition (e.g., 9.6, Embodied and Enactive Theories).</p><p id="p8280">Take all the brain data together and consider all possible combinations and permutations that work to generate the more than 100 billion distinct human personalities who have ever lived (each of whom has distinct states from moment to moment over decades of life). I hesitate to estimate the number of specifications that would be required. How could all these be accessed non-invasively, in sufficient detail, in real time, and simultaneously? The technologies exceed my imagination. But in principle, they are possible.</p><p id="p8285">A second potential deterrent to virtual immortality is quantum mechanics, the inherent indeterminacies that could make creating a perfect mental duplicate problematic or even impossible. After all, if quantum events (like radioactive decay) are in principle non-predictable, how then would it be possible to duplicate a brain perfectly?</p><p id="p8290">But quantum indeterminacies exist everywhere, in bricks just as well as in brains, so its special applicability to brain function, and hence to virtual immortality, is questionable. The crux of the issue is at which level in the hierarchy of causation, if any, does quantum mechanics make necessary contributions to brain function and to consciousness? (11). Certainly, the vast majority of neuroscientists think quantum mechanics works only at bedrock levels of fundamental physics, way too low to play any special role at the higher levels where brains function and minds happen.</p><p id="p8295">This means that while the sheer complexity of the brain would deter virtual immortality, and the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics might be an insurmountable obstacle to perfect duplication, the former would only delay its advent while the latter is probably not relevant. This leaves theories of consciousness—that same elephant in the room—which optimo-techno-futurists ignore as they plan their virtual afterlife.</p><p id="p8300">This section on Virtual Immortality follows from the previous section on AI Consciousness. It is my conjecture that unless humanlike, first-person inner awareness can be created in AI-empowered non-biological intelligences, uploading one's neural patterns and pathways, however complete, could never preserve the original, first-person mental self (the private “I”) and virtual immortality would be impossible. To the extent that the case for AI consciousness can be made, the case for virtual immortality strengthens. To the extent that the case for AI consciousness is weak, the case for virtual immortality weakens. AI consciousness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for virtual immortality. In other words, virtual immortality requires the same basic conditions as does AI consciousness, but then must add (unknown) orders of magnitude of greater constraints and complexity.</p><p id="p8305">What about well-known thought experiments where each neuron is replaced, one at a time, by silicon chips that are perfect replicators.

Not so fast. Personal identity, Schneider says, requires “spatiotemporal continuity,” such that any uploaded entity would not be your first-person self.

The causative power of mental states should not affect virtual immortality because a perfect duplication of the physical states would ipso facto produce a perfect duplication of the mental states. But if there were some strong emergence and/or top-down causation required, then those would also have to be duplicated in the upload.</p><p id="p8360"><u>Quantum Theories (11)</u>. If Quantum Theories are the mechanism of consciousness, then it is likely that virtual immortality would be attainable, because quantum mechanics is governed by highly predictable regularities, although the technology to do so would be more challenging. However, the indeterminacies, intrinsic probabilistics and strangeness of quantum physics add a degree of uncertainty that cannot be evaluated. The test, as with all potential causes of consciousness, is whether advanced technology can manipulate and control the cause of consciousness, and do so comprehensively and precisely and without meaningful error. The quantum nature of consciousness, if true, would introduce unpredictability and perhaps undermine perfect duplicability. For this reason, quantum theories, compared to other theories of consciousness, would have relatively less success in enabling virtual immortality than in generating AI consciousness (which is not to say it can do either).</p><p id="p8365">Stuart Hameroff thinks it is possible that “your consciousness can be downloaded into some artificial medium as the singularity folks have been saying for years, but without any progress whatsoever.” Referencing his and Roger Penrose's Orch OR theory of quantum conscious (11.1), Hameroff says, “It could happen in an alternative medium that has the proper properties,” he said, “perhaps artificial nanotubes made of carbon fullerenes.

If phenomenal consciousness requires an independent, non-reducible feature that may take the form of a radically new structure or organization of reality, perhaps a different dimension of reality—as IIT postulates—then virtual immortality could be possible, but it would be remain an open question whether our first-person mental self could be uploaded. As we do not understand this consciousness-causing structure, we could not now know whether it could be manipulated by technology, no matter how advanced. If this qualia space could be directed by activities in the brain, with predictable regularities, then virtual immortality would be more likely.</p><p id="p8375">Whereas many neuroscientists assume that whole brain duplication can achieve, ultimately, virtual immortality, Tononi and Koch do not grant to a digital simulacrum the same consciousness we grant to a fellow human. According to IIT, they say, “this would not be justified, for the simple reason that the brain is real, but a simulation of a brain is virtual.” Consciousness is a fundamental property of certain physical systems, those that require having real cause–effect power, specifically the power of shaping the space of possible past and future states in a way that is maximally irreducible intrinsically.” Therefore, they conclude, “just like a computer simulation of a giant star will not bend space–time around the machine, a simulation of our conscious brain will not have consciousness” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib796" name="bbib796" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib796"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Tononi and Koch, 2015</span></span></a>).

If Panpsychism is true and consciousness is an irreducible property of each and every elementary physical field and particle, then it would seem probable that our first-person mental self could be uploaded. There would be two reasons: (i) consciousness would be an intrinsic part of the fabric of reality, and (ii) there would be regularities in the way particles would need to be aggregated to produce consciousness—and if there are such regularities, then advanced technologies could learn to control them. But the question turns, again, on whether the micropsychic forces could be harnessed and manipulated by super-advanced technology, as can physical forces of fundamental physics (with varying degrees of difficulty and precision).</p><p id="p8385"><u>Monisms (14)</u>: As with AI consciousness, monism's single-stuff reality should enable virtual immortality—again, unless God or something like God (if it exists) were involved.</p><p id="p8390"><u>Dualisms (15)</u>. If Dualism is true and consciousness requires a radically separate, nonphysical substance not causally determined by the physical world, then it would seem impossible to upload our first-person mental self by duplicating the brain, because a necessary cause of our consciousness, this nonphysical component, would be absent. (An exception, again, would be Emergent Dualism [15.9], where unknown psychophysical laws would generate “souls” or nonphysical components “automatically.” But whether the same radically-unknown psychophysical laws would work equally well for virtual consciousness as for brain-based consciousness is a further complexity.)</p><p id="p8395"><u>Idealisms (16)</u>. If consciousness is ultimate reality, then consciousness would exist of itself, primitive, without any physical prerequisites. But would the unique, comprehensive pattern of a complete physical brain (derived, in this case, from consciousness) favor a duplication of a specific segment of the cosmic consciousness (i.e., our unique first-person mental self)? It's not clear, in Idealism's case, whether uploading would make much difference (or much sense). But, again, like AI consciousness under Idealism, virtual immortality under Idealism would turn on whether hyper-technology, maximally advanced, could harness and manipulate Idealism's fundamental consciousness. I can argue both sides: on the one hand, we are already composed of the same consciousness, so duplication is facilitated; on the other hand, the probability of being able to manipulate fundamental consciousness does not feel high.</p><p id="p8400"><u>Anomalous and Altered States Theories (17)</u>. As with AI consciousness, because Anomalous and Altered States theories of consciousness require “something” beyond, or in addition to, materialism, that “something” would be necessary but not sufficient to enable virtual immortality. However, given that almost every Anomalous and Altered States theory of consciousness already has ample (theoretical) resources to provide its own form or forms of immortality (supposedly), virtual immortality under Anomalous and Altered States theories would seem moot. After all, if you get the “real thing,” why worry about “virtual?”</p><p id="p8405">To summarize, in pursuit of virtual immortality, here are my (tentative) conclusions for each category of theories of consciousness. Materialism Theories: Yes. Non-Reductive Physicalism: Likely. Quantum Theories: Probably (with uncertainty). Panpsychism: Probably. Monism: Likely (some). Dualism: No (mostly). Idealism: Likely. Anomalous and Altered States theories: Not needed.</p><p id="p8410">Any theory, of course, would need to take on board all the brain-based complexities noted earlier, much underappreciated by optimo-techno-futurists.</p><p id="p8415">In trying to distinguish among these alternative theories of consciousness, and thus assess the viability of virtual immortality, I am troubled by a simple observation. Assume that a perfect duplication of my brain does, in fact, generate my first-person consciousness—which is the minimum requirement for virtual immortality. This would mean that my first-person self and personal awareness could be uploaded to a new medium (non-biological or even, for that matter, a new biological body). But here's the problem: If “I” can be duplicated once, then I can be duplicated twice; and if twice, then an unlimited number of times.</p><p id="p8420">What happens to my current first-person inner awareness? What happens to my “I”? Assume I do the duplication procedure and it works perfectly—say, five times. Where is my first-person inner awareness located? Where am I? Each of the five duplicates would state with indignant certainty that he is “Robert Kuhn,” and no one could dispute any of them. (For simplicity of the argument, physical appearances of the clones are neutralized.) Inhabiting my original body, I would also claim to be the real “me,” but I could not prove my priority. (David Brin's novel <em>Kiln People</em> is a thought experiment about “duplicates,” and personal identity [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib87" name="bbib87" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib87"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Brin, 2003</span></span></a>].)</p><p id="p8425">I'll frame the question more precisely. Compare my inner awareness from right before to right after the duplication process. Will I, the original, feel or sense differently? Here are four duplication scenarios, with their implications:<ul class="list"><li class="react-xocs-list-item"><span class="list-label">1.</span><span><p id="p8430">I do not sense any difference in my first-person awareness. This would mean that the five duplicates are like super-identical twins—they are independent conscious entities, such that each, after his creation, begins instantly to diverge from the others.

But if Scenario 1 is correct, then have “I,” the original “I,” achieved virtual immortality? No. I have a bunch of super-identical twins, an enlarged family, but no virtual immortality for “me.”</p><p id="p8455">Suppose, after the duplicates are made, the original (me) is destroyed. What then? Almost certainly my first-person awareness would vanish, although each of the five duplicates would assert unabashedly that he is the real “Robert Kuhn” and would advise, perhaps smugly, not to fret over the deceased and discarded original.</p><p id="p8460">There's a further implication of virtual immortality, and an odd one, relating to the possibility that super-strong AI, cosmos-colonizing robots could become conscious (see previous section). I can make the case that such galaxy-traveling, consciousness-bearing entities could include you—yes, you!—your first-person inner awareness exploring the cosmos virtually and (almost) forever. Here's the argument. If AI consciousness and virtual immortality are possible, then human first-person consciousness and personality can be uploaded (ultimately) into space probes and <em>we ourselves</em> can colonize the cosmos!</p><p id="p8465">If virtual immortality is possible, I'd see no reason why we couldn't choose where we would like our virtual immortality to be housed, and if we choose a cosmos-colonizing robot, we could experience the galactic journeys through robotic senses (while at the same time enjoying our virtual world, especially during those eons of dead time traveling between star systems).</p><p id="p8470">At some time in the (far) future, scientists will likely assure us that the technology is up and running. If I were around, would I believe the scientists and upload my consciousness? Moreover, entranced by what I assume will be AI-enhanced commercial advertisements, would I select a cosmos-colonizing robot as my medium of storage so that I could spend my virtual immortality touring the galaxy? I might, if only I'd be confident that a theory of consciousness that allows duplication is true and that the duplication procedure would not affect my first-person mental self one whit. (I sure wouldn't let them destroy the original, though the duplicates may call for it.)</p><p id="p8475">So, while all the duplicates wouldn't feel like me (as I know me), I'd kind of enjoy sending “Robert Kuhn” out there exploring star systems galore.</p><p id="p8480">There's more. If my consciousness is entirely physical and can be uploaded without degradation, then it can be uploaded without degradation to as many cosmos-colonizing robots as I'd like—or can afford. It gets crazy. Which makes me think there is something irreparably wrong with duplicates in specific and perhaps with virtual immortality in general.</p><p id="p8485">Whether non-biological entities such as robots can be conscious, or not, presents us with two disjunctive possibilities, each with profound consequences. If robots can never be conscious, then there may be a greater moral imperative for human beings to colonize the cosmos. If robots can be conscious, then there may be less reason for humans, with our fragile bodies, to explore space—but your personal consciousness could be uploaded into cosmos-colonizing robots, probably into innumerable such galactic probes, and you yourself (or your mental clones) could colonize the cosmos.</p><p id="p8490">My intuition, for what it’s worth, is that it’s all a pipedream. I deem virtual immortality for my first-person inner awareness to be not possible as a practical matter (given any hyper-technology), and perhaps to be never possible in principle. Does this commit me to a form of dualism? I'm not comfortable with the pigeonhole. But confident in my conclusion, I am not.</p><p id="p8495">While in the (far) future, we may find a way to convince ourselves that duplication really works, for me for now, I'm convinced of only this: Virtual immortality, like AI consciousness, must face the explanations and theories on the Landscape of Consciousness.</p></section><section id="sec25"><h2 id="sectitle1240" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">25. Survival beyond death</h2><p id="p8500">This section is somewhat repetitive. The reason is not just because there is absence of real knowledge about survival beyond death, which is obvious (to some), but also because what follows from each explanation or theory of consciousness with respect to survival is reasonably clear (even if, in some cases, ambiguous).</p><p id="p8505"><u>Materialism Theories (9)</u>. Death of the brain and body is death of the person, irrevocable and permanent non-existence. The conventional-wisdom way to maintain post-mortem, first-person subjectivity under Materialism Theories would be virtual immortality via hyper-advanced technology (see the previous section). Another possibility comes from the four-dimensional block universe interpretation of fundamental physics (the fourth dimension being time). As Albert Einstein wrote to the family of his friend, Michele Besso, who had just died: “Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”</p><p id="p8510"><u>Generic Subjective Continuity (9.8.13).</u> Naturalistic conceptions of consciousness, personhood, and self, tied to a physicalist picture of consciousness dependent on the brain, would seem to make it impossible, even ludicrous, to sustain the hypothesis that one's particular personal consciousness survives the dissolution of the brain upon death. Nevertheless, some (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib154" name="bbib154" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib154"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Clark, T., 1994</span></span></a>) have proposed that at death we should anticipate not the onset of oblivion or nothingness, but the continuation of consciousness—however, not in the context of the person who dies. Such “generic subjective continuity” suggests that consciousness, albeit tied to specific physical instantiations, never finds itself absent. One might stretch to find resonances with aspects of some Eastern eschatologies. (That this may or may not be welcomed by those facing death—many of whom have the hope of first-person-continuity life after death, and some of whom may prefer the onset of oblivion, not the continuation of experience in other contexts—is way beyond the scope of this Landscape.)</p><p id="p8515"><u>Non-Reductive Physicalism (10)</u>. Whereas death under Materialism/physicalism means total extinction of mind and consciousness, under some forms of Non-Reductive Physicalism, with mind not reducible, it is possible that God (if there is a God), or something like God, could bring the person back to life, a radical process often labeled “resurrection” (10.3).</p><p id="p8520"><u>Quantum Theories (11)</u>. If consciousness comes about via specialized quantum processes, then, at least superficially, death is still death as it is in materialism. However, looking deeper, the strange, counterintuitive nature of quantum theory introduces the possibility of radically new levels or realms of existence, such as the many-worlds interpretation and alternative world histories selected by future events. It is still hard to imagine how any of this could provide first-person survival beyond death to my inner “I” that feels and senses now.</p><p id="p8525"><u>Integrated Information Theory (12)</u>. If phenomenal consciousness requires a radically new structure or organization of reality, perhaps a different dimension of reality, then what happens to these inscrutable things cannot be imagined and their potential permanence in some sense cannot be rejected. This does not mean that IIT espouses or even allows life after death. What it does is highlight the mystery and importance of consciousness, which leaves the door to survival perhaps a crack more open.</p><p id="p8530"><u>Panpsychisms (13)</u>. If all aspects of the world are infused with consciousness, then solving the combination problem—how myriad microscopic panpsychic elements coalesce to form a macroscopic consciousness—could enable novel ideas about what may happen when the process reverses, when the macroscopic consciousness dissolves with the dissolution of the brain. It seems a long-long shot to first-person survival, but for some kind of survival, not in principle impossible.</p><p id="p8535"><u>Monisms (14)</u>. Having one kind of fundamental stuff makes ultimate reality simpler, suggesting perhaps that some kinds of monism may facilitate survival. For example, John Polkinghorne's “dual-aspect monism” enables a resurrection.</p><p id="p8540"><u>Dualisms (15)</u>. With its nonphysical soul or spirit independent of the body being the “real you,” dualism provides the clearest mechanism for survival beyond death. As such, dualism dominates religious traditions and spiritual systems. In addition to <em>resurrection</em> (Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and <em>reincarnation</em> (Eastern traditions, especially Hinduism and Buddhism), the vast majority of religious believers are sure that our individual soul or first-person awareness will, post-mortem, immediately be resident in some other realm. Popularity does not make truth, of course, but it is a data point. To reflect on dualism in reverse: If we knew counterfactually that survival beyond death was indeed a true fact of the world, we would likely infer that some kind of dualism is making it happen.</p><p id="p8545"><u>Idealism (16)</u>. Idealism allows survival beyond death because if everything fundamentally is consciousness, and thus consciousness is the ground of all being, then a nexus between our individual consciousnesses and the ultimate or cosmic consciousness can be readily imagined. (Parsimony is nice but not dispositive.) Indeed, Eastern religions have survival as fundamental doctrine, usually in forms and systems of reincarnation. However, survival under Idealism usually does not mean survival of one's current first-person awareness, but rather some kind of consciousness expansion (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib429" name="bbib429" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib429"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2016a</span></span></a>, <a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib430" name="bbib430" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib430"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Kastrup, 2016b</span></span></a>) or diffusion, like a person's one drop of personal consciousness absorbed back into the infinite ocean of cosmic consciousness from which it came. The issue of the afterlife in Indian philosophy is framed sharply by the question whether we will “eat sugar” (maintain our first-person identity) or “be sugar” (absorbed back into cosmic consciousness, lose our first-person identity) (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib534" name="bbib534" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib534"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Medhananda, 2023</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8550"><u>Anomalous and Altered States Theories (17)</u>. Survival beyond death of personal consciousness in some form is a prime feature of Anomalous and Altered States theories. Almost all categories of psi/paranormal (i.e., NDEs, OBEs, ESP, parapsychology, past lives) have “life after death”—if not as its central doctrine (which some do), then at least as a major aspect. Whether “communicating” with dead relatives in séances or “remembering” past lives via hypnosis, survival gets attention. In fact, survival is a main motivating reason why people are attracted to psi/paranormal phenomena in the first place.</p><p id="p8555">To summarize, in pursuit of survival beyond death, here are my (tentative) conclusions for each category of theories of consciousness: Materialism: No, with possible exceptions for virtual immortality and a four-dimensional block universe. Non-Reductive physicalism: Unlikely (possible exception: resurrection). Quantum Theories: Maybe (even if so, it would be in formal, abstract ways of uncertain meaning). Panpsychism: Unlikely (long shot). Monism: Unlikely (possible exception: resurrection). Dualism: Yes, with first-person consciousness preserved. Idealism: Yes, with first-person consciousness blurred or banished. Anomalous and Altered States theories: Yes. Generic subjective continuity: No, but consciousness survives death in a generic, not a personal sense.</p><p id="p8560">I remain eagerly though skeptically open to speculation. I won't fool myself.</p></section><section id="sec26"><h2 id="sectitle1245" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">26. Reflections</h2><p id="p8565">When I did my PhD in neurophysiology (mid-1960s), I felt somewhat embarrassed, as an apprentice scientist, to be seen taking consciousness seriously. I'm now proud of it, though it's no longer risky. There is today great interest in consciousness among scientists—some, in context of AI potentially becoming conscious, calling the issue “urgent” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib495" name="bbib495" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib495"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Lenharo, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8570">I appreciate Christof Koch pioneering neural correlates of consciousness; David Chalmers challenging conventional wisdom in philosophy of mind; and John Leslie, from whom I've learned much, showing me new ways to think about ultimate matters. I admire two physicists who have long taken consciousness seriously. Paul Davies suspects that the universe is “about” something and that consciousness is no accident<em>.</em> Andrei Linde was advised to take the word “consciousness” out of a cosmology manuscript so that fellow scientists wouldn't lose respect for him. Andrei responded, “If I take ‘consciousness’ out, I'd lose respect for myself.”</p><p id="p8575">Artist/philosopher Mariusz Stanowski, on seeing an early pre-proof of this paper, challenged my statement that “whatever the ultimate explanation of consciousness, it is somewhere, somehow, embedded in this Landscape of theories." He argues that “creativity is producing coherent structures/syntheses as opposed to producing collections. Your article is such a collection of views on consciousness and your comment doesn't change that. The solution lies outside this landscape.” (Stanowski's own “theory of contrasts” offers “direct contact with reality” where coherent structures are built from simple elements, gradually increasing in complexity,” such that “complexity means integration, value and goodness” [<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib725" name="bbib725" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib725"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Stanowski, 2021</span></span></a>]).</p><p id="p8580">To be clear, I am <em>not</em> saying that the ultimate theory is already here on the Landscape, hidden in plain sight, but rather whatever the ultimate theory turns out to be, its fundamental elements could be categorized according to Landscape structure, with family resemblances to some current theories.</p><p id="p8585">I turn again to Jerry Fodor and his pithy appraisal of consciousness theories: “Nobody has the slightest idea how anything material could be conscious. Nobody even knows what it would be like to have the slightest idea about how anything material could be conscious” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib262" name="bbib262" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib262"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Fodor, 1992</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8590">Scanning the Landscape, I'd like to say we have progressed. I'm not sure I can.</p><p id="p8595">Those who write about consciousness like to quote, with bemused irony, psychologist Stuart Sutherland's cautionary words: “Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon; it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib750" name="bbib750" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib750"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Sutherland, 1989</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8600">Slyly, we all hope to be the exception. More likely we corroborate that Sutherland had us all nailed.</p><p id="p8605">Philosopher William Hirstein is more optimistic. In response to the early Landscape pre-proof, he noted, “You cast a broad net (you even caught me!), which is exactly what's needed at this point. Also, taken all together, it [Landscape] provides a fascinating look at the whole of human intelligence coming up against a problem, one that is vital for us. The diversity of these views is part of a larger point that, as a species, diversity is our strength: we each tackle problems in our unique ways, and (hopefully) someone will win the lottery. Moreover, a goodly percentage of the views are inter-consistent: just touching different parts of the same elephant” (<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#bib374" name="bbib374" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="bib374"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text">Hirstein, 2024</span></span></a>).</p><p id="p8610">Me, I just don't know … My own hunch, right here, right now—if I'm coerced to disclose it and for what little it's worth—might be something of a Dualism-Idealism mashup.<a class="anchor u-display-inline-flex anchor-primary" href="#fn71" name="bfn71" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-type="reference" data-xocs-content-id="fn71"><span class="anchor-text-container"><span class="anchor-text"><sup>71</sup></span></span></a> (I can describe; I dare not defend.)</p></section><section id="sec27"><h2 id="sectitle1250" class="u-h4 u-margin-l-top u-margin-xs-bottom">Note to readers</h2><p id="p8615">Feedback is appreciated, critique too—especially explanations or theories of consciousness not included, or not described accurately, or not classified properly; also, improvements of the classification typology.</p><p id="p8620">I look forward to providing updates and making revisions.

Peter and I have been working together since 2006, producing and broadcasting over 300 TV episodes (and counting) and over 5,000 web videos. It is hard to overstate the complexity of a <em>Closer To Truth</em> TV episode, for which Peter is responsible: planning relevant and visually interesting filming locations; organizing large crews (12–15 members) and complex equipment; coordinating guest logistics; and managing the myriad steps in post-production hands-on.

Then, after the seven years, “my understanding returned to me and I blessed the most High.” (Dan. 4:34). Assume (for the moment) that this really happened, how could this have literally happened?
