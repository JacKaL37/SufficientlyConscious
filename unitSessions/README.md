A space for pulling in materials for discussion / recording sessions, doubling as a from-the-hip curriculum unit for learning the same topics. 

defined by: a central topic, likely a section of a paper

things that might belong in one of these: 
- notes / talking points
- external materials and links
- supporting ideas, e.g.: "I dunno if they can experience altered states, buuuuut... have you seen how you can make it think it's [The Golden Gate Bridge](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/) by scrambling its brain?"
- AI prompts for guided discussion of the topic (maybe used live!)
- exercises / interactive tasks / whatevers
- discussion recordings
  - long form, unstructuered discussion
  - short-form content deliverables
