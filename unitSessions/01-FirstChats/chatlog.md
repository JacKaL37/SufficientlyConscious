I was so excited when I saw this. It's such a big deal to have everything in one place
History of philosophy is actually a lot more important than people realize

A lot of them are similar, so you'd need to make a clustering algorithm based on inter-agent agreement/disagreement

I'd like to start with the question: Why should we care about consciousness?
Teja Sunku
11:24 AM
If you're more of an engineer, then we care more about "does it work?" What functional utility does consciousness have?

my hottest topics: 

GREAT! topics:

Neurobioloogical
Computational and Informational
Embodied and Enactive

Ethics for sure
Teja Sunku

+ you can prove unprovability in some cases so that could valuable by itself
JKL

Why focus on consiousness:
- ethics
- queer theory
- understanding our place on the spectrum of consciousness and compllexity
JKL

Tiktok hot topics:
- Monism / Non-Duality
- Global Workspace Theory (v agentic)
- Minsky
- Chomsky

If I'm allowed to add any, then I would think about Panpsychism and altered states. I feel like you think about this for any amount of time, your mind just ends up going in those directions

electric field theory-- bioelectric field stuff, can mess with the organism. 

nano-tubules would be my first perspective

Particularly if we're going to have meaningful discussions about AI hallucinations, we'll need to figure out what a hallucination actually is. AFAIK not all theories of consciousness allow us to talk about hallucinations as a thing by itself

Actually Liz, can you just delete the list and write "everything"

If we want to talk about consciousness and its relationship to logics, then I will be a good resource. Otherwise, I am here for the ride

Having lived with someone who underwent a psychotic break, I think people might generally be interested in hearing about what goes on. I've learned more people than I would have thought have had a loved one gone through something similar and might want to tune in for that

but generally Yes!

my current votes:
- the Why of consciousness
- microtubules
- global workspace theory

Do any of theories talk about tool use, and the relationship between tools and a consciousness. I suspect Global Workspace theory might, but I don't know literally anything about it

maybe enactivism
Teja Sunku
11:57 AM
Well, even for us. Like, I'm already using LLMs so extensively. We've already seen huge impacts on memory and thinking from technology like written language, digital storage systems, the internet etc
Yes, 100%

I have to drop. But I'd love to talk again soon!
