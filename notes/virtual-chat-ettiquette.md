# Remote Conversation Recording Guidelines

This isn't meant to get all snooty-- fuck most "ettiquette" classes, y'all. Hear me? FUCK YOUR FORK PLACEMENT!

But, we've all been doing this virtual communication thing for a while, and some good practice patterns have emerged. 

(And most of us are curious-minded neurodivergent weirdos, so, these'll go doubly for us.)  

Ramp up your mindfulness on the following things: 
- **conversational turn-taking.**
  - promote good turn-taking, leave pauses for interjections or questions or etc.
  - remember that "pass the turn" is a valid action. 
- **space-taking.**
  - conversational space is limited, so be mindful of simultaneous speaking and infodumping complete paragraphs.
  - both double-speaking and over-rambling are audio poison
- **topic relevance.**
  - topic-jumping is big in adhd-town, but it's jarring for the listener and conversation partners.
  - try to delineat "this is an aside", or "tangentially related!" so that your conversation partners know what you're on about.
- **question asking.**
  - a great way to baton-pass is to formulate a question to ask other conversants.
- **lag and collision handling.**
  - the speed of light is fixed, so lag is a property of nature. i.e., we WILL collide and talk over each other.
  - keep a mind on recognizing when someone else MIGHT have started talking before you.
  - when in doubt, be the first to pause and say "oh! go ahead?" and at least check in. 
- **audio quality.**
  - we recordin', so gussy up your audio input if you can.
  - use your best stuff! standalone mic? good headset? let your pretty voice ring true, y'all.
  - also do mic checks (scratch or puff tests), operating systems love to fuck with default mic settings. 
- **body language cues.**
  - some of the above happen mostly because we aren't sharing physical space.
  - we give all kinds of feedback to each other unconsciously
  - if you're comfrotable and able, flip the cameras on and make them BIG so you can see our whole whatevers.

We want to strike a balance between Lecture-with-Hand-Raising (yuck, stuffy) and full chaos (unlistenable). 

It feels a bit silly to codify these things, but I've found over several years of hosting virtual events that a set of mutual social touchstones kept in mind helps smooth things out a LOT.
