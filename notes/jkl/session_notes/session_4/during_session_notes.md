structure plan for the podcast:

- quick cold-chat beforehand, talk shop a bit, get some cut away segments for a cold open
- do the show
- debrief afterward, reflect on the podcast structure and stuff

segment-based
- intro
- philosophy: prep some philosophy content yourself
- social media: grab any interesting/upsetting/wild instagram or tiktok posts to share
- fun ones / on the fly
  - letting an AI do our podcast for us
  - chatting with consciousllama

one per episode:
- 1-2 philosophy topics
- 1-2 other more fun segments

new idea for a lefty project: 
- SOMETHING hyper-local, on-device only. 
- local-only! locallll! 
- something that can hype up mutual aid
