Overall idea: Trying to build a structure for picking 2-3 discussants to debate ideas on consciousness. 


we should pick a model. 
- for testing, let's just fuck with `gpt-4o-mini`. cheap, fast, and competent enough for a sketch
- later:
  - I don't think I trust gpt-4o's quality on things like this. It can't followe a "be concise" instruction to save its fuckin' life, I dunno.

- fast-dumb solutions:
  - use MASS conversation 
  - [Groq](https://groq.com/) is a solid choice
  - [Cerebras](https://inference.cerebras.ai)

- Batch API? half price, 24 hour delivery time.
