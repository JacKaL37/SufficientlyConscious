provocateur~!
- "if I stop thinking, I might stop existing." - Descartes
  - an interesting wrinkle!
  - anecdote about computational cognitive models
  - parley into note about modern AI in the same realm
    - lean into my thing about "I think it might be *a little* conscious, but only for as long as it is producing tokens."
- "i'm a thinking thing"
  - sort of lands right on it, right? what IS a "thinking" thing?
  - we are, sure. 
  - are llms?
- he's pretty big on the "brain in a jar" concept of consciousness
  - pretttttttty good match for the experience of an LLM... hmmmmm

unrelated musings

- examining the "edge" of consciousness
- some folks say brain, end. 
- but this fails to capture the dynamicity between the brain and the environment
  - affordances, plasticity, etc

- e.g.: cut out my tongue.
  - ahhh fuck, that sucks for me. no more locution, and I wouldn't be very good at giving... party favors. 
  - but! you say. I still have my mind! I am unchanged!
  - am I?
    - my affordance structure with the world is radically altered now-- i can no longer look at people in physical spaces and see them as "easily communicated with"
    - and moreover-- your brain has **plasticity**, part of which has a "use it or lose it" view of neural real estate (We could learn something here...)
    - e.g., sensory neurons for a missing limb have been shown to be recruited and rewired for auditory processing
    - we can expect the same with my changed environment relationship-- I can't openly speak to communicate anymore. That takes a lot of networks, a lot of coordination, and speech production itself will atrophy (though typing may not!)
    - the pathways we once frequented are going to be renegotiated. 
    - so. 
    - am I the same?

- e.g. 2: the chihuahua in a mech suit.
  - terrified little dog, living in a big, scary world
  - but! put him in a mech suit, and he's a terror!
  - but! is he the same dog?
    - his affordances have changed
    - his relationship to the world has changed
    - his brain will change in response to these changes
    - so. 
    - is he the same?
