### **Descartes and Doubt**
- Radical doubt
   - Doubts everything, even senses
   - Evil demon thought experiment

---

### **First Meditation**
- Doubting the senses
   - Senses can deceive (illusions, dreams)
   - Infinite doubt leads to no certainty
   - Searching for a foundation for knowledge

---

### **Second Meditation**
- Cogito Ergo Sum
   - Doubting itself proves existence
   - I think, therefore I am
   - Minimal definition: Thinking as proof of being
   - Thinking = doubting, questioning

---

### **Implications for Consciousness**
- Consciousness as self-awareness
- Consciousness as thinking, doubting
- Consciousness independent of external world
- Active process of doubting, engaging with thoughts

---

### **Generative AI through Descartes’ Lens**
- AI lacks subjective self-awareness
- AI can reflect, revise outputs (error correction)
- AI as a "brain in a jar"
   - Disconnected from external reality
   - Operates on internal data/context
- AI meets minimal definition of thinking
   - Processes, asks questions, adjusts reasoning
   - No volition, but mirrors Descartes’ reflective process
