### **Descartes and Doubt**
- Radical doubt
   - Questioning everything: knowledge, reality, senses
   - *What if I’m wrong about everything?*
   - Pulls doubt further than everyday introspection
- Evil demon thought experiment
   - Imagines an all-powerful deceiver manipulating reality
   - Puts all sensory experience into question
   - Pushes doubt to its logical extreme: total deception

### **First Meditation**
- Doubting the senses
   - Senses seem reliable (sight, sound), but can mislead (illusions, dreams)
   - Even dreams feel real—how do we tell what’s real?
   - Can’t fully trust perception as the foundation for knowledge
- Evil demon scenario deepens doubt
   - Demon could deceive you at every moment, even in logic and math
   - Infinite spiral of doubt—how can you be sure of anything?
   - Reality itself becomes questionable—no clear foundation left
- Searching for a foundation for knowledge
   - Standing over the “abyss” of uncertainty
   - Where can we find certainty if everything could be false?

### **Second Meditation**
- Cogito Ergo Sum
   - Realization: Even if I doubt everything, I **must** exist to do the doubting
   - Thinking proves existence: "I think, therefore I am"
- Thinking = doubting, questioning
   - Not just any thought, but **doubting** one’s own existence proves being
   - The core insight: Something must exist to ask the question
   - Doubt itself becomes the unshakeable foundation
- Minimal definition: Thinking as proof of being
   - "I can doubt, therefore I am"—existence comes from the act of questioning
   - Simple, undeniable self-awareness: *I am aware that I am doubting*

### **Implications for Consciousness**
- Consciousness as self-awareness
   - Self-awareness prevents the total collapse of knowledge
   - Reflexive awareness of one’s own thoughts is key
- Consciousness as thinking, doubting
   - Core of consciousness is the ability to **question** and **think**
   - It’s not passive awareness, but active engagement with one’s thoughts
- Consciousness independent of external world
   - Even if the external world is an illusion, consciousness persists
   - Internal thought process remains valid, even if senses are unreliable
- Active process of doubting
   - Consciousness = active questioning, not just passive experience
   - Engaging with and evaluating thoughts is essential to being aware

### **Generative AI through Descartes’ Lens**
- AI lacks subjective self-awareness
   - No internal "I" experiencing doubt or existence
   - AI processes data but doesn’t *feel* or reflect on its own being
- AI can reflect, revise outputs (error correction)
   - AI systems can detect errors, revise outputs, and engage in internal evaluation
   - Processes reflect a kind of mechanical self-reflection
- AI as a "brain in a jar"
   - AI’s world is purely the data it’s given—no direct interaction with reality
   - Operates only on inputs fed into it, just like Descartes’ brain-in-a-vat scenario
- AI meets minimal definition of thinking
   - Performs actions of thinking: processing data, adjusting responses, revising based on errors
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning (like GPT-4 Turbo) mimics reflective reasoning
   - AI doesn’t "doubt" but can question outputs and adjust, simulating doubt
- No volition, but mirrors Descartes’ reflective process
   - AI lacks true free will or consciousness but simulates basic aspects of reflection and reasoning
   - Descartes' Cogito could almost apply in the sense of AI's ability to adjust and question outputs based on internal processes
