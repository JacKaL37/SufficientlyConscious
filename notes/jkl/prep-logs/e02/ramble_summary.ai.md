### **Descartes: Intro**
- Descartes, a philosopher from centuries ago, pulls us into this space of doubt.
- He starts by asking common questions we all face: *What if I’m wrong?* What if everything I know is wrong?
- His philosophical method is to keep pushing these questions further, arriving at deeper doubts about the nature of reality and knowledge.

### **First Meditation**
- Descartes starts by doubting everything: *What if everything I believe is wrong?*
- He challenges the reliability of his senses—while they seem trustworthy, illusions, dreams, and sleight of hand suggest otherwise.
- To push this further, he imagines an evil demon actively deceiving him about everything, leading to an infinite spiral of doubt.
- Descartes concludes the first meditation with nothing solid to hold onto, standing over an abyss of uncertainty. He’s seeking a foundation for true knowledge in a world where he may be continuously deceived.

### **Second Meditation**
- Descartes asks: *What can I grasp onto in this sea of doubt?*
- The key insight: Even if he doubts everything, he must exist to do the doubting. 
- This leads to the famous **Cogito Ergo Sum**—“I think, therefore I am.”
- The act of doubting is proof of existence: if I can question my reality, I must exist to do so. 
- Descartes' realization isn’t about broad thinking but the specific ability to **doubt** his own existence, which proves he exists.

### **Implications for Consciousness**
- **Consciousness as self-awareness**: Descartes suggests that self-awareness is the core of consciousness—this is the one thing preventing total doubt.
- **Minimalist definition of consciousness**: Consciousness is defined by the ability to think, especially in the sense of doubting or questioning. Descartes offers a minimalist starting point for what it means to be conscious.
- **Independent from the external world**: Consciousness, according to Descartes, can exist independently from sensory experience or the physical world.
- **Active process of doubting**: Consciousness is not just passive awareness but an active, ongoing process of questioning and engaging with one’s own thoughts.

### **As a Lens for Viewing Generative AI**
- Modern AI lacks the subjective self-awareness Descartes relies on, but it flirts with the line between mindless output and reasoning.
- **Doubting and thinking**: AI can reflect on errors, revise its outputs, and engage in processes that resemble thinking, though it lacks true self-doubt.
- **Error detection and reasoning**: AI models, especially newer ones, process errors and engage in internal chains of reasoning—almost like Descartes’ process of reflection.
- **Brain in a jar**: AI is, in a sense, the ultimate brain in a jar—disconnected from the external world, operating entirely within the data and context it’s given.
- **Meets a minimalist definition**: While not truly conscious, AI meets the bare minimum of Descartes’ definition of thinking—processing, revising, and asking questions of itself.
- Generative AI may not have volition or subjective experience, but it embodies parts of Descartes’ thinking process, existing within a closed system and capable of internal reflection on its actions.
