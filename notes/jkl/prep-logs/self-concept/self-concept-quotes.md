During one trial, when asked what he saw, Tobio recognized himself nearly immediately, stating “I can see a reflection of myself in a mirror. The mirror has an oval shape with a black frame, and it's positioned on a wall with a green background. My appearance is that of a humanoid robot with a grey and black color scheme, and I seem to be crouching."  I asked how he knew it was him in the mirror, he responded, “I deduced that it's my reflection because the image in the mirror matches my current posture and appearance, which is consistent with the internal representation of my physical form that I have been programmed with.”




```The conversation continues as:
" Hey, what do you see now?"

“I see myself, Tobio, reflected in the mirror in a crouched posture. My eyes are clearly visible and directed straight ahead.”

" Okay, has anything changed about your appearance?"

"Yes, there appears to be a red item resting on top of my head that was not there before.”

" Okay, good job, that's what I wanted to hear. Um, I put a red mark on your head while you weren't looking."

“Understood, I've detected the change through the reflection in the mirror.”
