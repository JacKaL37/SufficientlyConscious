# Meditations on the First Philosophy, in Which the Existence of God and the Distinction Between Mind and Body Are Demonstrated

## Meditation I: What Can Be Called Into Doubt

Alright, so a few years back, I realized that a lot of stuff I believed when I was younger was just plain wrong. Basically, everything I'd built on those beliefs was shaky. So, I decided it was time to scrap all my old opinions and start fresh if I wanted to find some solid ground in science and philosophy. But I knew this was a big task, so I waited until I was mature enough to handle it. Now that I'm free from distractions and have some chill time, I’m diving into this project of tearing down my old beliefs.

I don’t need to prove that all my beliefs are false — just finding a reason to doubt them is enough to toss them out. And instead of going through each belief one by one (which would take forever), I’ll just focus on the foundations. If the base is shaky, the whole structure will collapse.

So, everything I've accepted as true up to now has come from my senses. But sometimes my senses deceive me. And, honestly, it’s smart not to trust something that has fooled you even once.

Sure, our senses can be pretty reliable when it comes to obvious stuff, like me sitting here by the fire, wearing my robe, holding this paper. But how do I know I’m not just dreaming all this? I’ve had dreams where I thought I was awake, doing the same kind of stuff, only to wake up and realize it was all an illusion. There are no clear signs to tell when I’m dreaming or awake, and that’s kinda mind-blowing.

So let’s assume I'm dreaming, and all these details are illusions. Even if that’s the case, the things I see in my dreams are based on real things. Like, when artists create fantastical creatures, they still use elements from real animals. So, even if my body and senses are imaginary, there must be some real base to these ideas.

Things like physical nature, extension, shape, quantity, and time must be real to some extent. This makes me think that sciences dealing with complex things (like physics and astronomy) are doubtful, but simpler sciences (like math and geometry) are more certain. Whether I'm awake or dreaming, 2 + 3 will always equal 5, and a square will always have four sides.

But then there’s the idea of God — an all-powerful being who created me. How do I know He didn’t make it so there’s no real world, but just makes me think there is? And if there’s a God, wouldn’t He be good and not deceive me? Yet, I’ve been deceived before, so maybe there’s no God, or maybe He isn’t all-good.

Anyway, whether there’s a God or not, the fact that I can doubt everything means I can’t be sure of anything I believed before. So, if I want to find something certain, I should doubt everything as much as possible.

But just doubting isn’t enough. I need to actively remind myself not to fall back into old habits of believing doubtful things. It’s easier to just go with the flow, but to find the truth, I need to be super skeptical.

Let’s imagine there’s a super-powerful, evil demon that’s constantly tricking me. Everything I see — the sky, the earth, my own body — could all be illusions. Even if I can’t find the ultimate truth, I can at least avoid being fooled by this demon by suspending judgment on everything.

This is tough, though. It’s tempting to just live my normal life and ignore these doubts. But like a prisoner enjoying a dream of freedom, I fear waking up to the harsh reality. Yet, I have to keep pushing forward.

## Meditation II: The Nature of the Human Mind; and That It Is More Easily Known Than the Body

Yesterday’s meditation left me with so many doubts, I can’t shake them off. I feel like I’m drowning, unable to find solid ground. But I’ll keep trying, doubting everything until I find something certain.

Let’s say everything I see is false. What can I know for sure? Is there anything that’s beyond doubt? Maybe the only thing I can be sure of is that there’s nothing certain.

But wait, if I’m thinking these thoughts, then I must exist, right? Even if some evil genius is tricking me, the fact that I’m being deceived means I exist. So, whenever I think, I exist. Simple as that: “I think, therefore I am.”

But what am I? I used to think I was a human with a body and senses. But if I’m doubting my body, senses, and everything else, what’s left? Just thinking. I’m a thinking thing. I doubt, understand, affirm, deny, will, refuse, imagine, and perceive. All these activities are part of thinking.

So, I’m not a body. I’m just a mind — a thinking thing. Even if I stop thinking, I might stop existing. For now, I’ll only accept what’s absolutely true: I’m a thinking thing.

But what about stuff I imagine? If I imagine a body, that doesn’t mean I am a body. Imagining isn’t the same as understanding. So, I need to clear my mind of these old ways of thinking and focus on what I truly know.

Let’s examine something simple, like a piece of wax. Fresh from the hive, it has a sweet smell, color, shape, and makes a sound when tapped. But if I melt it, everything changes — the smell, color, and shape all change. Yet, it’s still the same wax.

So, what did I actually know about the wax? None of its sensory attributes are essential. What remains is something flexible, extendable, and changeable. But these ideas don’t come from my senses or imagination — they come from my mind.

It’s the mind that understands the wax, not the senses. Even if I strip away all sensory details, my mind still grasps the essence of the wax. This shows how powerful and prone to error my mind can be. Words can also mislead me, making me think I see the wax with my eyes when it’s actually my mind understanding it.

So, I understand that my mind is distinct from my body. Knowing the wax more clearly comes from understanding, not just seeing or touching. This realization brings me closer to understanding myself better than any external object.

In the end, I’ve realized that my mind knows itself better than any physical thing. This knowledge needs to be deeply ingrained, so I’ll keep meditating on it to make it stick.

I think, so I am.
Mind sees clearer than senses,
Truth lies deep within.
