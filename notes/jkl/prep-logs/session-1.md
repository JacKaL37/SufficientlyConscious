fine fine, bonafides. what am I about tho?

We're in this era where access to intelligence is becoming increasingly trivial, and the more we make sure we LEARN HOW TO WIELD IT, the better off we'll all be. 

In part, I'm endlessly curious about how these things work-- a strange mind showed up at the cosmic dinner table, and it speaks english. What's its nature? What responsibilities do we have TO it, and also *about* it?

And what are the dangers? We have to learn how the tools work to understand the ways people will begin exploiting them to exploit us. All AI education is half "Defense Against the Dark Arts"

And another thing-- you into leftist principles? You want to seize the means of production? here it fucking is. 
- First, the open source world adopts the radical perspective that Tools Are For Everyone. There is no concept of false scarcity to exploit in FOSS, which helps innoculate it against the worst of capitalist exploitation.
  - quite the opposite-- anything you create can instantly be shared across the entire planet, more or less for free.
- AI tools are becoming fully open sourced-- the best frontier model last year, GPT-4, has now been surpassed by an open-source (or perhaps "open weights", but freely available) model, Llama 3.1 405B. 
  - If you have a "no true leftist" argument here, then let me remind you: who gets points when you leave tools on the table? If you think radical purity can survive what's coming, you need to pay more attention. 
- So now, imagine merging these ideas-- open source access to all tools being created all the time, and riding sidecar is an intelligence that was not only trained on these types of things, but a SHITLOAD of other material that now empowers YOU to do whatever it is YOU want to do to improve your world. 


Anyway, what I'm *not* is a rigorously trained philosopher. Cognitive science certainly gets me in the door to the conversation-- philosophies of science, of mind, of consciousness, they all show up and are discussed, it's one of my favorite features of the field, that downward spiral into an abstract frontier. BUT! I'm amateur, I don't always speak the lingo, I don't always know the terms, and I haven't exhaustively studied the field. 

I got some thoughts, but this is a learning exercise for me, too.

Searle

got a funny relationship with searle-- he's aggressively non-dualist, which I align with.

-- Aside: Science Isn't Optional, it's Fundamental

but, he's also really into the idea that the mind is a biological process, which I'm not down with.

I sort of see that as having your cake and eating it, too-- you want to be a materialist, but you also want special magic privilege applied to neurobiology. 

Let's crack into what I mean--


## 9. Materialism theories
- We live in a physical world, and everything known to have ever been observed has been the result of a physical process. Light, chemistry, heat, friction, impact, electricity, neural impulses-- it's all physical. 

There's reasonable skepticism here, looking at it from the level of a passerby. Like, damn, you want to reduce all of this wild, robust conscious experience to atoms and molecules vibrating?

Yeah, dude. Of course I do. 

Because of **complexity**. 

Everything that we think is magic, eventually turns out to be some complexity of the world we didn't yet understand. Why does the weather move that way? Why do planets wander strangely against the backdrop of the stars? 

The answer is that the beauty, the magic, the irreducible complexity of the reality of the world-- it's all hidden complexity. 

And I don't find that sad at all, I find it invigoratingly beautiful. 

We can approach the world with a sense of "what the fuck is that supposed to be?"

### 9.1 Philosophical theories (of materialist consciousness)

Try to arrange fundamental philosophical principles into a coherent theory of consciousness.

#### 9.1.6 - Searle's biological naturalism

This is where Searle offers some strong footing for materialist approaches to consciousness.

A prime point of his is that a lot of our debate over dualism vs materialism is sort of an artifact of upholding philosophical traditions. 

Rather, when you get right down to it, consciousness is a Real Thing That Exists, and it exists in a biological form. 

He defines consciousness as "Conscious states are those states of awareness, sentience or feeling that begin in the morning when we wake from a dreamless sleep and continue throughout the day until we fall asleep or otherwise become ‚Äòunconscious‚Äô" (Searle, 2007b; Searle, 2014a).
- a good workind definition to begin the discussion

From here, he adds some depth in the form of key features:
- qualitative (see "qualia")-- there's a FEEL to conscious states
- subjective-- it exists only in first-person, as experienced by the human or animal
- unified-- you have one conscious experience. it might be lumpy, but it's unified, from the core of your brain to the extent of what you can perceive in the world, that's where it fits in. 
- intentional-- in the philosophical sense, your states are ABOUT things, they are relational. 

// followups tho: extended mind, embodiment, and what about... the written word? After all, when you die, you amount to dust, and all thoughts ever written in your hand. (vienna teng lyric, passage)


He elaborates-- 
- Consciousness is REAL. As in, it exists at its own level of complexity and it has its own properties
  - // citing Supervenience
  - MEANING: you can't simple reduce it. The same way you can't reduce Nutrition to atomic processes-- those atoms interact in very different ways, and in very different capacities depending on the complexities at play in its context. 
  - The same is true of Psychology broadly-- Personality traits can't just be reduced to neural firing patterns, because it's too far a reach to try to extrapolate millisecond impulses in your chemistry up through biology and into Predicting Something About Your Personality. 
    - There are stops on the way! 
    - See, this is why I vibe with Searle to an extent
- BUT-- consciousness also MUST be caused by biological processes. 
  - Back to psych-- there may not be a clean mapping from "neurons firing" to "personality trait", but it's still the case that "personality traits" EMERGE from neural activity. That's all we've got in there. Memories, thoughts, trauma, love-- it's all encoded in your neural pathways. 

Here's a sticky bit: he adheres to the idea of "biological naturalism"
- consciousness exists at the level of biology (at minimum), in our world. 

Let's break that apart:
- Biological -- field of science, living cells, including things like neurons and their interaction (neurobiology)
- Naturalism -- in the philosophical sense, this means Explainable Using Natural Science.

Now, this does carry an edge that implies biology is a *necessary* component for consciousness, but I don't think that's expressly what he means. I think he would argue that it is SAFEST to associate biology with consciousness, since biological organisms are the only things we know of that have the capacity for consciousness.

And that's fair-- people give "behaviorism" in psychology a bad reputation because it sounds like it's saying "cognitive processes don't exist, there is only behavior". But that's not what it's saying-- it's saying "we can't observe cognitive processes, so we're going to focus our study on behavior instead".

And that's what I think Searle is doing here. 



BUT. Homeboy takes it too far, in my book, with the famous, infamous, reviled and revered "Chinese Room" argument. 


### What's a Chinese Room?

Or any [insert language here] room. Let's call it Klingon, because using earth languages is stupid and lends itself to xenophobic bullshit.

AI quicknotes, since I already know this biz well and I'm out of time:

### the chinese room üèØ

**what it is:**
- proposed by john searle to challenge the idea that computers can have a mind or understand language
- imagine a person who doesn't understand chinese inside a room with a set of rules (in english) for manipulating chinese symbols
- the person receives chinese characters, uses the rules to produce appropriate responses, and sends them out
- to an outside observer, it looks like the person understands chinese, but they don't‚Äîthey're just following rules

**main point:**
- searle argues that this shows computers (which follow programmed rules) don't truly understand language or have a mind, even if they appear to

### the system reply üñ•Ô∏è

**what it is:**
- counters searle's argument by saying that while the person in the room doesn't understand chinese, the entire system (person + rules + room) does
- the understanding is attributed to the system as a whole, not just the individual parts

**main point:**
- the system as a whole can be said to understand chinese, even if the individual components (like the person) do not


### the robot reply ü§ñ

**what it is:**
- another counter to searle's argument, suggesting that if the computer were embodied in a robot that interacts with the world, it could develop understanding
- the idea is that understanding requires more than just symbol manipulation; it needs sensory and motor experiences

**main point:**
- a robot with the ability to perceive and interact with its environment could potentially understand language and have a mind, unlike the isolated chinese room scenario

```haiku
symbols in a room
systems and robots may know
mind's true form debated
```

---


### searle's response to the system reply üñ•Ô∏è

**what he says:**
- searle argues that even if you consider the whole system (person + rules + room), there's still no understanding happening. he suggests that you could internalize all the rules and symbols in your mind, and still, you wouldn't understand chinese.

**main point:**
- just manipulating symbols according to rules doesn't lead to understanding. the system as a whole doesn't have any more understanding than the individual parts.

### searle's response to the robot reply ü§ñ

**what he says:**
- searle acknowledges that a robot could interact with the world, but he argues that this still wouldn't lead to genuine understanding. the robot would just be processing inputs and outputs based on its programming, without any real comprehension.

**main point:**
- adding sensory and motor experiences doesn't change the fundamental issue. the robot, like the chinese room, would still be following programmed rules without true understanding.

### overall stance

- searle maintains that **syntax** (symbol manipulation) is not the same as **semantics** (meaning). no matter how complex the system or how interactive the robot, they can't achieve true understanding just by following rules.

```haiku
rules and symbols dance
no true meaning in their steps
mind's depth still unknown
```
