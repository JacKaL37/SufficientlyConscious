Some notes. 

First task is a cursory sampling of in about an hour:

Gonna follow my classic paper digestion pattern-- process and digest each of these iin order, with some reflection: 


1. Title, Author, Journal -- note anything that comes up

2. Abstract -- get the elevator pitch

3. Table of Contents -- get a sense of structure and topic flow

4. Conclusion/Reflection/Wrapup -- Focus on conclusions they think are take-homes

5. Figures/Tables/Etc -- get a sense of the evidence / arguments / models / etc at play

6. Methods/Results (if appplicable)

7. A more complete read

After each of these steps, take a beat, write down NOTES, OBSERVATIONS, and QUESTIONS that bubble up. 

THIS IS A SPARSE ACTIVITY! Don't belabor any given point, try to move at the speed of thought. 
This is about becoming more fluent with the topics, not exhaustive analysis.



^ that's, ironically, a bit exhaustiive, I just wanted to get it down on paper ^


quickie: who am i?
- cognitive scientist. I've run neuroscience studies, I've done computational cognitive modeling, and I hang out with ecological psych types
- prime exposure to philosophy is twofold:
  - philosophy of science
  - philosophy of mind
- I can tell you right now: neither of these practices allows for dualism or idealism.
  - They're information and data-based, they're evidence based, and they're based on the **material conditions**.
- If a theory rests entirely on the concept of "magic mental stuff", then I simply won't consider it. Sorry, dude.
  - this is why I'm not billing myself as a philosopher.
  - I am NOT open to all possible interpretations, and I find that that particular sort of navel gazing is often wasted, masturbatory effort.
  - Not naming names in a public document, but I've had colleagues. 

A GOAL today: pick a good first-topic in a potential series on this



let's go, wasted enough time on artifice--


LOG

Title/author/journal:
- whytf is this in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology?
  - might imply a rigorous approach, but be wary of weird depth-straying (academic exp talking here)
  - "I understand physics! I must understand everything!!" -- my ex-physicist friend talking about her field
- Love the landscape and taxonomy idea

Abstract:
- Very much a "surveying the land" approach-- tons of categories in this vein. The aim seems to be exhaustive, and I'm into that effort.
- minimal critique, mostly trying to gather sources and let them speak for themselves here.
- four guiding questions:
  - meaning, purpose, value
  - AI consciousness
  - virtual immortality
  - survival beyond death
 
the last two feel very samey and needless complication, but we cool

TOC:

Hoo doggy, this is already the bulk. let's goooo


the background sets the stage with some existing conflicts (to drive the work), with some background evidence. 

it culminates in the idea of the landscape, which sections 9-18 tackle MEGA STYLE. 
- today's GOAL can probably be found in here, so I'll spend the last 15 miinutes of my prep processing these

by the end, we get to summaries of the guiding questions (see abstract above), with some reflections. 

I'll skim those sections next--


21 - 26 skimming (4 mins, baby):


21
OOh, 21 iis punchy as fuck, love the writing. 
That’s it. The explanations and theories on the Landscape of Con-
sciousness—currently. They will change.
As promised, I shall not adjudicate among them, rank them in some
order, critique this or that. Nor, should I try, would I have much confi-
dence in my own, idiosyncratic views.
Scanning through all of them, this blizzard of explanations and
theories, I respect but resist Colin McGinn’s old admonition: “The
mystery persists. I think the time has come to admit candidly that we
cannot resolve the mystery” (McGinn, 1989).
We go on.
That’s what it means to be human.
I’m asked by viewers of Closer To Truth why I don’t take more stands
and give more answers to the big questions we pursue. I respond that if I
knew, I’d tell—I’m keeping no secrets. Rather, I’ve learned to luxuriate
in the questions, with an agnosticism that is proactive and passionate.
Now the fun part. I turn to implications of the explanations or the-
ories of consciousness with respect to four big questions: (i) ultimate
meaning/purpose/value (if any); (ii) AI consciousness; (iii) virtual
immortality; and (iv) survival beyond death.
What can be said? Most must be speculative, of course, but some
general principles might hold.

mm, not sure I'm a fan of how much service this document pays to dualism and idealism. 
my hot take: the idea that there must be something "magical" about the complexity of a neurological system underlying a human mind is hopeful thinking and self-delusion. 
you are what you are. 


23 ai consciousness???

(ooh, let's focus these in today's chat)

Butlin's 2023 paper sounds useful. 

it does take a "do the right kinds of computations --> necessary and sufficient!" 
-- computational functionalism
-- said to be challenged by other "rivals" on the landscape

Hah, Searle. Man, are we still sucking this guy's dick?
- Searle posed the thought experiment, and then used nothing to truly back it up.
- BOTH the system reply and the robot reply are far more compelling than his responses to either.
- Okay, but he does have a point, that because we can't pin consciousness down well, we shouldn't weigh in too heavily at early stages. 

Biological essentialism -- that never turned out bad for anyone, right? Right? Right?

This has me wanting to pinpoint my own take:
- Still Undetermined. I'm not bullish on AIs BEING conscious, but I can certainly see the building blocks for operational *minds*. We're on that path. 



## Okay, gotta look at the topics lists...


Man, there's still so much here lol. 

hmm, let's think about approach for "first topics"

I think maybe I'm looking for topics that are most accessible FROM a fledgling ai-learner's standpoint. I'll do a heatmap--

heatmap of the Materialist theories:
- philosophical theories: good (good background and basis for a lot of this)
- Neurobiiological theories: GREAT! (good for comparison!)
- Electromagnetic fiield theories: mid (real-time complex dynamics focused)
- Computational and Informational theories: GREAT! (we computin' baby)
- Homeostatic and Affective theories: good (good for agents! drives and urges and such as defined by the environment)
- Embodied and enactive theories: GREAT! (roomba go brr)
- Relational Theories: good
- Representational Theories: good
- Language Relations: good
- Phylogenetic evolution: good


restructured: 

GREAT! topics:
- Neurobioloogical
- Computational and Informational
- Embodied and Enactive

Good topics:
- Philosophical
- homeostatic
- relational
- representational
- language
- phylogenetic

Mid topics:
- Electromagnetic fields





This is a good start! We can focus in on some of these broader sections.
